Among the F aunistic works, that trcat of European Arachnida, BLACKWALL'S
Spiders ‘ff Great Britain and Irelzwd (1861—1884) and VVESTRING’S Ara-
ozeoe Saea-icco (1861) undoubtedly 0661111)ν 1116 first place, both on account
of the high degree of perfection, to which these two works have carried our
knowledge 01 1116 Spider-fauna of these two countries, and for the light they
spread upon a large number 01 previously unknown or only imperfectly
known species of the group of animals whereon they t1·eat.¹) A compara-
tive examination of these two almost contemporaneous works is in more than
one respect a matter of the greatest interestg indeed a comparison of the
synonymous denominations of the various species described in them is abso-
lutety necessary, 101. 36 63611 01 these authors appears to have been igno-
rant 01 1116 other's works — even those, which had been published previously
to the works above mentioned — it has happened, that a large number 01
species common 10 both have been described in each with a totally different
nomenclature. The results, to which I have been led by such 3 compari-
son, have been 1116 primary cause of my making, and also constitute 1116
principal subject of, the following annotations, in which Ι 11316 first and
principally endeavoured to fix the nomenclature 01 1116 spiders known to me,
that 316 describes] in the works of &VESTRING and BLACKWALL, adding such
remarks as I supposed to possess any synonymieal importance or utility.
To these notes ou WESTRING⁷S and BLACKWALL'S works Ι 11316 added some

ly take its place beside the works of BLACKWALL and Wsss'rRmG, is ΜΕΝ-0116 Ρνειιε-
siselze δμίηηιιη, Danzig 1866-68. Another less extensive but highly meritorious per-
formance is OHLERT'S Die Araneiden oder echion Spinnen der Provinz Prenssen,
Leipzig 1867. To both these works we shall iu the following pagos often have oc-

casion to refer.
