2 T. TuonELL,

remarks on a third almost contempfflancous per-folmance7S1MON'S Histoire
Natio-elle des Α’νυιῖζψιόεε (1861), 01, more 111-011611) speaking, 011 the ''Ca-
taloque §nummumque des Arane‘z'des ΕῑινορσἫεηηθέ which follows it, for that
catalogue appears to me in many points 10 require a thorough revision, 10
which Ι was 1166110116 of offering some sporadic contributions.

As the value of remarks 011 61166166 of animals and plants 16 often
somewhat equivocaL unless they 116 accompanied by descriptions or some other
guarantee that the species are rightly identified⁷ I consider myself bound to
inform my readers, that Ι can with 11611661 confidence refer to the descriptions
111 XVESTRING’S Araneoe Senecione, as really belonging 10 1116 spiders declared
by me in the succeeding pages to 116 identieal with species described by him·
During many years' 1661116066 111 Goteborg and constant intimacy with this
gentleman, my respected toacher and friend, Ι have had the opportunity
of bccoming accurately acquainted with by far the greater 1111011161· of the
species described by him in that work, and all Swedish 611111616, that I
have since collected, I have 66111 10 116 examined by him, wherever there
was the least doubt about their classification. Moreover the species describ-
ed by XVESTRING, which are wanting in my own collection, I have, with
very few exceptions⁷ had the opportunity of examining3 601116 of them have
been sent me for examination from the Zoological department of the Natio-
nal Museum in Stockholm by the kindness of Prof. C. 815111, and others Ι
have received from XVESTRING himself.¹) As I have, in identifyiug the 6111-
ders described by SUNDEVALL7 followed Wesrnmo, who had SUNDEVALL'S
own collection at his disposition, and whose determinations of the species
found 111 that author are accordingly perfectly trustworthy, and as I have
010160161- myself examined a collection of spiders made by CLERCK‚ and
have consecrated a great part of the last twenty years to arachnological
researches in just that province (Uppland) of Sweden, where OLERGK‚ LIN-
NP'] and DE GEER 111611 and laboured ‚2) Ι may reasonably make 111-6161161006

 

1) Ι 11116 this oppoltunity of openly expressing my thankfulness not only to Μ1·
11116Το1116, 10 1111001 my thanks are more particularly due 00 account of the nume-
rous and Valuahle communications that I have received from him concerning our Spider-
Fauna, but also 10 Prof. 811111, 10 Dr. HAGLUND and other friends who have sent me
the Swedish spiders they had collected. Ι also beg to express my most sincere gra-
titude to Prof. LovssN and to Mr. AHLSTRAND7 Librarian to the R. Acad. of 86160666
111 Stockholm7 for the indefatigable kindness and attention, with which they have pro-
culed me the loan of several important works of arachnological litte1··,atuie to Which

I could not otherwise have had access.

logists I have already published the two following works: Recensz'o critica Amnem-um
