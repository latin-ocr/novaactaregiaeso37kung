4 Τ. THoRELL,

As fundamental principle we of course go 0111 from the so called
Low Prioritatis, Which ord-ains that each premes preserve tlte ymeri}- name, and
each species the speczflo name, hy iohich z't was first made lcnowm the name of
the person, who first described or figured such genus or species under
the aforesaid name, being added as ’‘azetizoritff'. The reasonableness of this
law is so clear and evident, that I should not have thought it necessary to
mention it, were it not that there are persons (even among arachnologists),
who seem to live in total ignorance of its existence and of every one's du-
ty to conform to it.¹) Simple as this rule is, some difficulties present them-
selves in its application, which may give rise to differences of opinion.
One might e. g. ask iii iohat manner a name ought to be given 111 order
to have the right of being preserved. We conceive that the name ought to
be followed by a definition or climacioterization of tho object named, i. e. either
(which is preferable) a description (diagnosis), or afigyure, or at. least a refe-
rence to some previously existing description or figure, moreover that such
name and accompanying eharacterization ought to be printed and published,-
that accordingly 110 other denominations than those, which have been giv-
en in the above named manner, ean, 111 fixing the scientific nomencla-
ture of, animals (and plants), be taken into consideration. Hence it follows
that 110 0110 needs pay any attention either to names published in print
zmaocompanied by (lesc1·ipti011s,²) nor to denominations given 1ο natural

1) That the scientific names of animals and plants must he Latin (i. e. have a
Latin form) would seem to be selfevident. Any person 111011, who describes a new
species by 0. g. a French name only, cannot expect that a such denomination should
be respected on the ground of priority. If such names, for example, as Atlzelyue
clccdophore, Prosteilze oannem (Vid. HESSE‚ Mem. sur deux nouv. genres de l’ordre des
Orust. sedentaires etc. in Ann. des Sciences Nat, 4 Ser„ Zool., Tom. 18) are to be
generally used, they must first be provided with a Latin form, and the right ofprio-
rity (and authority) must be assigned to the work, where these animals are first en-
tered with their Latin denominations. For this reason we consider that 0. g. the
genus called by LATREILLE in his Cours d'Entomologie‚ 1831, &ascesi-acantho and
which SUNDEVALL in his Gonspect. Araehn. 1833 calls Gasteracantha (Gastraccmthus
WEsrw. 1835), must be properly designated as Gasteraomztha (SUND.) 1833.

2) If, when a genus has been once set up and characterized, there should be
given, as a type of it, some species, named indeed, but not 111111101- described, but
concernirzq which no uncertain& is possible, Ι think that also such speeific name ought
to be retained Not only the genus but the speeies is in this ease sufficiently di-
stinguished by the characteristics of the genus. An example of this is afforded by
Filristata testacea LATR. 1810 (= F. bicolor WALCK. 1820—25).

Neither does it appear reasonable, when a species has been described under a
new generic name, to reject such ymerio name simply because the characteristics,
