the epoch of a denomination, is the time when it was in the above urrannei*

which distinguish the genus, have not been separacely set forth in the description.
Nevertheless that now very common method of forming new genera is by uo means
so deserviug of commendation and imitation as it is easy and convenient.

To reject a name, as some have proposed to do, on account of difectizreness in
the definition, would seem not to be right, as leaving room for much arbim-ariness.
What seems to one good enough may to another appear insufficient or faulty. When
one only knows with certainty what is to be understood by such a name, every one
ean either alter or improve the characterization for himself. A new genus on the
contrary⁷ that has been distinguished merely by referring to some particular species
of an older genus as it's type, without in any way indicating, which of the characte-
ristics of the species is to be considered as the mark of the new genuS, no one can
indeed be looked upon as bounden to acknowledge3 nevertbeless it appears to me
advisable to do so, especially if the species referred to deviate in any generally
known manner from the typica] species of the old genus, and always if the new ge-
nus has been once received and acknowledged by a subsequent investigator; the right
of priority ought also then to be assigned to him who first proposed the name.

1) One is of course no more at liberty to take an azetlzori'ty from such sources
than to take a name from them. It is for this reason that e. g. for the names of the
spiders described in Reuss' Zool. Miscell. (Mus. Senek. Ι) Ι always cite Rnuss as the
authority, although he has in most cases appended ’⁷W1DER'’ to the names: I do not
in fact consider myself at liberty to doubt, that Reuss is the author of these Zoo-
Zoyisclze Miscellen and of the descriptions that occur in them, and have nowhere seen
it stated that they were written by WIDER. Probably in WIDER'S collection and his notes
thereupon these spiders have borne the names, under which Reuss has published them.

Again when it is certainly known, that the person, who has published for ex-
ample a description, is not really the author of the same, then it is evident that the
name, that ought to be cited as authoritby for the described genus or species, is
that Of the real author.

2) Ι am perfeetly aware that, especially on this last mentioned point, considerable
differences of opinion exist, and that many consider that the priority ofa work ought
to be reckoned from the day, when it was delivered to the academy or society. Others
are of opinion that every separate printed sheet ought to bear the date of its delive-
ry to the press and that from such date priority ought to be reckoned. Aga-inst the
first of the opinions here urged it may be objected, that it would frequently mislead
a person who endeavoured to ascertain the true date, when an observation was first
made or a species first described, because an author has frequently the opportunity
of making extensive corrections and alterations in his manucript and proot'sheets,
