(3 T. THORELL,

This last case it is especially important to take notice of, for a consider-
able time frequently elapses between the day, when a paper is thus deliver-
ed, and that, 011 which it is made accessible in print to the public, neither
ought it to be forgotten that printed works often bear upon their title-page
a date different from that, at which they really appeared, and which accor-
dingly ought to stand there. —— If a name has been published without caracte-
rization, and this latter be supplied in a subsequent work, the name should
be considered as originating at the epoch of this latter and not at that of
the fornici· work.1)

Another question requiring an answer is the following: Ηοῑυ far baele-
ward z'n time ougylu‘. the (φρῖῖσαΐῖοη of tlze law of priority 1‘0 be emtendecl? —
Here it would seem that a difference ought to be made according as the
question regards the name of a genus, 01· that of a species, and the pri-
ority of yenerie and specific names to be decided independently of each
other. Firstly and principally as regards the names eff species, it will
probably without difficulty be admitted, that, since the Limaeam binomz'nal
nomenclatura for all species both in the vegetable and animal kincr-
doms is that which is universally received, the introducam of that nomen-
clatm‘e into science ought to constitute the epoch, from which priority should
be reckoned, at least in the case of specific names. The prae-Liunaean
authors, as is well known, distinguished the different species of a genus,
not by a ”nomen triviam, as LINNE calls the specific names consisting of a
single word, which he introduced, but by a brief diagnosis, ”women specificum”
or ’'dg'fferentz'a sy2ecifica⁷⁷, which generally consisted of several words, though
occasionally it might be comprised in but one, and in this latter case as-
sumes to the eye the appearance of a nomen triviale. Some modern writers
occasionally go back to these prae-Linuaean denominations, and receive the
differentiae ,specificoe that consist of a single word, or even the first word

 

even until the last sheet leaves the press. We object to both alternatives, that no
0110 is bound to know of a work as long as it, either as manuscript 01· even as prin-
ted, lies coneealed 111 the author⁷s‚ publisher’s, or any learned society's stores. When
it has been made accessible to the publio in yeneral, then, and not previously, can it
be said to have been publishesl. Many disagreeable eontroversies eoncerning the
right of priority might be avoided, isit were the general custom to reg-ister consei-
entionsly upon every work the day on which it was offered to the public in the book-
sellers' show, or, in cases where no exposure for sale takes place, when the distri-
bution of the work was effected by some other process.

1) According to this rule some of the species-names used by WALCKENAER in
his Tableau <les Arane'ides (1805) will have to give place to others, published at a
suhsequent period.
