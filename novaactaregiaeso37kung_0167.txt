look upon as one, that should altogether be rejected: it is easily pcrccived
that it opens wide the door to unlimitcd arbitrariucss, and that it is incom-
patible with the fixing ot' any determinate limit to the application of the
law of priority. We assume theu as a rule, 111111 in ‹Ietermz'nz'nsy 1110101011-

(Amoenitates Acad„ Π, p. 2²25 4262) for the sake of brevity ('⁷ut brevitati studeam⁷’
says he) reduced the differentia specifica to a single word: it was however in the
Philosophia Botanica (ξ 257) that he for the first time proposed the laws of his new
system of nomenclature: the term nomen triviale is here introduced, and it is stated
that this nomen triviale, or specilic name, shall consist of

''Vocabulo uno'' and

''Vocabulo libere undequaque desumto'',
whereby it’s essential difference from the old diagnosis or differentia specifica 15111111-
cated. ——- me': in that work still continues to use the expression ”nomen speeifieum'¹
as synonymous with differentia specifica: and it is in the Species Plantarnm (1753)
that ”nomen specificum⁷' first occurs in its now generally accepted signification, i. e.
as identical with nomen triviale or species-name.

2) It is however to be remarked (Cous. Recensz'o crit. Aram, p. 4.) that some
authors, and among them L1NN12: himself, have, in works, in which they must still
be considered as having consistently employed the binominal nomenclature, sometimes
used trivial names compounded of two, usually closely connected words, (e. g. Oa-
mbas crux major LINN.‚ Aranens X notatus CLERCK7 Aranea resupina domestica DE
GEER, Mieryplmntes ferrum equinum Germe), a custom by no means deserving of
imitation. If the two words, of which such a specific name consist, be not closely
connected, so as to express a single idea (as is the case with '’resupina domestic&

DE Germ), the name ought in all instances to be rejected.
