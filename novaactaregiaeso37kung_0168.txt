sometimes nomina trivialia, sometimes verbose differentiae specificae to distin-
guish the species they treat of.¹)

It appears furthermore from this, that we ought not, asin some
quarters has been proposed, to fix upon either the ΧΜ, 01· 51111 1655 1116 A 71⁰²
Eclz'tz'on of Linnffs Sys-tenna Natum as the starting point from which prio-
rity in specific names is to 116 reck011ed.²) For most Classes of animals uo-
mina trivialia have been first employed by Lmnn himself, and that in the
X ‘⁷¹ Ed. 01 1116 Systema Naturae3 but this is not the ease with all, and as
regards sz'ders in particular, CLERCK has already 1757, in his famous work
'’Svenslca Sffl'mllar, Araozei Snecici'’‚ applied LlNNE's nomenelature with per-
fect consistency, and accordingly the denominations given by him 111 that work
have right of priority in preference to the Linnaean, as I have more 1111157
shown in my Rec. crit. Aram. p. 4 et seq.

As regards yeneric names the above named Committee seems to as-
sume, that 101· them, as for specific names, priority ought not to be recko-
ned farther back than to the date of Systema Natum Edit. XII (1767):
SUNDEVALL 011 1116 contrary considers Edit. I 01 that work (1735) as 111611-
11111 that ought to be chosen. The most reasonable and consistent method
would perhaps seem to be, either to rcckon the priority of gcneric names
also from the epoclz qf the introduction of tlte binominal system into the sci-
ence, with the same limits, that we have indicated in the case 01 specific
names, i. e. from 17513 or else to take into account, in determining that pri-
ority, cell works in which species have been consistenzly yrouped z'n ’'yenera'⁷‚
in 1116 modern meaning 01 that word, quite as, in determining the 111-1011157
01 specific names, account should be taken of all works, in which nomi-
na trivialia are consistently used. Against the first alternative the impor-
tant objection may be made, that since in Botcmy a large number 01 far
older generic names has been generally accepted — botanists in fact rec-

 

 

1) GOEZE has (in ’'LISTERs Natuigeschichte d. Spinnen'⁷) undertaken to give na-
mes 10 a number of spiders described or figured by some older authors, as ALBIN and
SCHAEFFER3 but as among these names some occur of such a form as for example*
”Arcmea ten-a abdomine mm‘ronat0''. ”A. atro—alboque lineatffl, there is surely no rea-
son to burden the lists of synonyms with these names, nor to make any account of
them in determining questions of priority. For the names of the spiders figured by
SenAEFan, priority should be reckonecl from PANZER'S Syst. Nomencl. 10 SCHAEFFER'S
1601165 Insect. Ratisbon. (1804).

fZ) The above named British Committee proposes Ed. XII (1767), SUNDEVALL
(in Arsberiittelse 'osver Zoologiens framsteg 1840—42) with more reason Ed. X (1758)
— as being that in which the binominal system was first applied to both kingdoms
of organic nature -— as the starting point for specific names.
