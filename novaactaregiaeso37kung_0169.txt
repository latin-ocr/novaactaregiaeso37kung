kon the priority of these names from ToURNEFORT’s ¹) Instz'tntiones Rei Herba-
φίας (1719) - 1110 admission of that alternative would cause too great a
difference between the rules of zoological and botanical nomenclaturc. As
for the second alternative, it cannot be thought of 101· 1110 simple reason,
that it would certainly be impossible 10 determine, when and by whom the
101111 genera, 111 the sense in which 11. 10 now usually understood, was first
applied. Now there being 111 Zoology contemporaneously with TOURNEFORT’S
Instz'tutz'ones Rei ,Herbarioe 110 such epoch-constituting work to go out from
— for it must 110 admitted that, with respect to nomenclature, that is not
the case with the famous works 01 RAY, — it would seem to 110 1110 11001
course and that which requires the least change in the existing nomencla-
ture, 10 0001010000, as SUNDEVALL has proposed, reckoning the claims of
priority for yenerz'c names from LINNE‘S Syst. Nat. Edit. I (1735), the first

the time of RAY and TOURNEFORT, and that 111 which for the first time real
genera are arranged and defined 000010101111)7 throughout the animal king-
dom. —- Some few zoologists indeed remove the limit 01 priority to a much
earlier period: XVILLOUGHBY, 3011110101, ALDROVANDus, and even ARISTOTE-
LES (who did not write in Latini) have been cited as ''authority'' after ge-
ueric names, although 101 several af these authors genera, 111 the modern
meaning of the word, had 110 existence. Moreover it would be a matter of
110 small difficulty 101 those, who go back to so remote times⁷ to discover
who first employed such generic names as e. g. C'am‘s, Perea, Musca,
Awmea! — Iu Arachnologsy the manner 111 which this question may be
determined is 1011000101)ν 01 110 consequence, as all the genera comprehend-
ed in the classifieation 01 Spiders have been formed subsequently to the
commencement of the present century.

It follows immediately from the law of priority, that 11 the same
name should have been given 10 1110 dfferent cenet-a (gf animate, it belongs
to the genus first described under that 11ame3 the other genus receives the
next oldest 01 the names under which it has been made known, 01 111 1110
absence 01 such, receives a new name 2). The same rule of course holds

1) '’TOUNEFORTIUS primus characteres genericos ex lege artis eondidit”: Lnsm„
Philos. bottul„ ξ 209,

2) If a genus has been described by two different names, and has resumed (or
ought 1ο resume) the elder of them, the younger 001110, 01· synonym, ought not 10
110 considered as free and unappropriated, and should not be employed as name
of any other new genus than 0110 formed by dividing the genus to which it was
originally applied.
