if two different speeies belonging to the same genus have obtained the same
”nomen triviale'⁷. If several genera be united in one, that one ought 10 116
distinguished by the name of one of them (preferably the oldest), and 011110
account be called by a new denomination. And again if 0116 genus 116 re-
solved 11] several, that genus which contains the typical species& of the
old genus ought to retain the old generic name3 the other new genera ei—
ther receive new names, or (as is preferable) are distinguished by synonyms7
if such exist, of the genus, at the expense of which they have been form-
ed.²) Entirely 10 reject the old generie name and form new names for
all the new genera that result from the division, is in general 3 reprehen-
sihlc course. An exception may be made of the cases 111 which the old na-
me is an ordinary nomen appellativum‚ which is equally applicable to 311 1116
61166166 included under the old 1131116, 311(1 16 01· might be used as the de-
nomination of 3 whole Order or Closs, 36 16 the case e. g. with the name
Amnem-³) 311 exception may also be permitted, when the genus (livided does
azot constitute any natural mzity, i. e. when there 16 110 61166166 11131 6311 116
considered as typifying it. We cannot therefore complain that such generic
names as 6. g. Allonoculus LINN. and Binoculus GEOFFR. have been rejected
by later naturalists, though we do not 1116311 16 maintain that 611611 3 61611
was either necessary or deserving of ilnitation.4)

116 111061 6611111101] 111, 01· typieal of 3 genus, it seems to me desirahle, when 3 genus
16 divided‚ and the person, who made the division, 1136 determined for what spe-
cies he would preserve the ancient name, not to make any alteration in it. Thus for
example, although the spider called by SUNDEVALL Saltiensformz'earins is neither the
commonest species within the old genus ›Saltlous LATR., nor yet typieal of that ge-
nus, 61111 we retain with SUNDEVALL, who was the first who divided the genus, LA-
TREILLES generic name for just that very 61166166.

genda⁷': LINN„ Phil. bot„ ἓ 244. ’'Antiquum si disjungitur genus, nova nomina effin-

3) It will hardly be questioned that it is better with SUNDEVALL to call the or-
der of Spiders Arccneoe than for instance fio-anaides, an ill-concocted word, that sounds
no better than for example Avicles instead of Aves or Serpentides instead of Serpentes!

LmNn even lays down as a general rule, that ”Nomina generiea, Classium et
Ordinum Naturalium nomenclaturis communia, omittenda sunt'’. (Phil. bot, ξ 233). This
rule however must be considered 36 bearing with a little modification: at least a
generie name cannot (except in the above mentioned cases) be rejected because
some class or Order has subsequently received the same appellation.
