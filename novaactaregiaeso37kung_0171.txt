Besides the cases here mentioned, in which dcviation from the law
of priority is necessary or allowablc, one 111016 (16561105 tobe 1111110611. 11711011
a word taken from 1110 Latin or any ot' the more modern languages, and
the signification of which is unquestionable, is applied as the scientific na-
1110 of a genus, which, according to all ordinary 111165 ot' etymology, it can
by no means indicate, it cannot 110 011101 1111111 fitting to reject such generic
name and rcplace it with another. Thus the name Tau-antula FAER. (1793)
e. g. has very properly been generally discarded in favour of the newer
name Plzryoms OL1V.; and the former name is now rightly applied 10 that
genus of Lycosoidae‚ which includes the Tay-antula so often spoken of both
by ancient and modern authors.

The names of different genera are often not indeed absolutely iden-
tical, but so similar, that it may 116 doubted whether they can be allowed 10
1011111111 together or not. It is however only when the names are properly
speaking identical‚ and the difference contined to the spelling, that Ι 111110
thought it necessary to reject the later name or names: thus for example two
such names as Ariadne and Ariadna, Galen& and Galama, Ssrilwdros and
Spodrus cannot of 0011150 110 allowed to exist beside one another. Many
names differ only in gyender and in having different ternzz’mztions: and, though
0110 ought of course in future to avoid forming names distinguished only in
this manner from others already accepted, it appears to 1110 111111, when they
have once 001110 into general use, they may be retained, for the opposite
course would be attcnded by too great changes in 1110 existing nomenclature.
Ι do not therefore consider that in the names Atta and Attus, Antonia and
Aulonz'zmt, Euryopz‘s and Euryopa and such like, the use of the one name
excludes that of the other. ¹)

I cannot agree with the British Committee in consider-ing that a known
and received zoological generic name ought to be rejected, if it should pre-
viously have been used to denote a botanical ymas, 01 vice versa, as it is
scarcely possible that any misunderstanding or other inconvenicnces can arise
from the retaining of such names. The consistent carying out of such a

belonging to it be taken as the generic name of that 51100105, it ought no longer
to be at the same time retained as specific name, but the species should receive the
next oldest specific name, by which it has been described, or, in the absence of
of such other name, a new one. Such names for example as Tarentum Tarentum,
Trutta Tracta ought accordingly to be rejected.

1) In some instances persons have taken upon themselves to change whole series
of generic names, 50 115 to give them all the same terminat-ton. Such changes I do
not think it worth while to notice.
