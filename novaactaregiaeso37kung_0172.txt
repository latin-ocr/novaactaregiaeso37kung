wholesale doom of cassation would lead to much confusion both in zoologi-
eal and botanical nomenolaturest) '

It is rightly observed by the British Committee, that a name once
published is the property os the science, and cannot therefore be revoked
or altered, not even by the person who has imposed it. Exceptions however
exist, and we have already (pag. 10, 11> mentioned a eouple: the Committee
also admits, that there are names which ought unquestionably to be disum-ded,
those namely, which in their signification are absurd or false. It would have
been desirable that this sentence of reprohation had been extended also
to certain classes of those names which the Committee only considers that
naturalists ought in future to abstaz'n from forminy (''objectionable names⁷⁷).
Such are for instance monyrel names (compounded of two or more different
languages) —— e. g. Cirrhq'fem from κιρρός and fero — and names manufactured
by mutilating and mangling other names, e. g. Cypsnagyra from Cypselus and
Tcmafsrafl) To this class belong also the equally barbarous denominations
that have arisen from the ridiculous practice of composing unmeaning generic
names of arbitrarily combined letters, usually 111 1118 form of 311 anagram:
e. g. Rooinela, Conilem, Οἱνοῖαηα, Αηίίοσνα, formed from the letters in Ca·
rolina. We hope the time will come when also such names as those just
mentioned will be rejected ,³) though this is not yet the case. But certainly

1) LINNIZ is even more severe than the British Committee 111 11118 matter: not
only will he not permit the same generic names to 118 used in botany and zoology 01·
mineralogy (Phil. bot, ἓ 230), but he even adds: ”nomina Generica cum Anatomico-
111111, Pathologorum, Therapeuticorum, vel Artificum 110111811813111118 80111111111113 omit-
tenda sunt’⁷: ibid, ξ 231. FAssniems lays down the same 11118 (Phil. entom.⁷ ἕ 21,
p. 108); but it would be vain now to attempt to get it applied. —— Some modern authors
have gone into the opposite extreme, and maintain that two or more genera of
animals ought to be allowed to have the same name, if only they do not belong to the
same order. This assumption is in direct opposition to the hitherto universally re-
ceived praxis in most branches of zoology. In arachnology e. g. the names Lycaena,
Hecczffrffe, fllacczrz‘a have been discarded, because these generie names had been
previously given to animals of another Clas-s.

2) Some other equally ill compounded names have very properly been discarded
hy more modern zoologists. Thus for example SUNDEVALL has rechristened the
bird-genus Mallzerbipicus (from MALHERBE, the ornithologist, and picus) Pediopipo
[Conspectus Avium Picinarum p. 77 (1866)]; and GUNTHER [catalogue of the Fishes
in British Museum, Vol. V, p. 387 (1864)] has changed into Coccia the crazy name

Ichthyococczw, given to a genus of fishes in honour of an Italian ichthyologist, and
eompounded of his name, Cocco, and ἰχθύς]
