one ought to be at liberty to ‹mzend such in other respeets appropriate deno-
minations as are in a less serious degree erroneozesly formed. This right —
which is far from being universally aeknowledged, although defended and used
by several good zoologists ·—— ought to belong not only to the person who first
published the name, but also to every one who observes and can correct the
error. That e. g. LATREILLE changed his fllicromata to alim—ommam, and
the absmd name Clzzbz'ona lapidosa VVALCK. to C'. lapidicola, and that
these latter appellations have been generally received, ought therefore to
be approved, and in virtue of the same right we alter e. g. WALCKENAER'S
Drassus rubrens to D. rubens (as iu fact MENGE and OHLERT have already
done), his Epeira myabora to E. myiobora, Latrodectus to Lath1‘0dectus‚Lz'-
pistz'ns to Liplzz'stz‘us (λείπω, ἱστός), Deinopz's to Dinopis, as also it is now
usual to write Locez'a pityopsz'ttacus, fflqmnomem‘a, Histioplzorus, Clzz'roo‘nys etc.
instead of L. pytiopsz'ttacus, Yponomeutw, Btioplzoruffi Clzeiromys. The right
of making such improvements must be granted, in order to prevent the no-
menelature of zoology from gradually assuming au appearance absolutely dis-
gusting to a person possessing even the slenderest elassieal attainments.
As long as the scientific names of animals and plants are to be Latin, we
have a right to require that they do not sin against the simplest laws of
that language. One is not, it is true, obliged to learn Latin aud Greek in
order to oeeupy oneself with Natural History: we are fully aware that a man
may be a very distinguished naturalist without having had a classical edu-
eati0n3 bnt he who does not know sufficient Greek and Latin as to be able of
himself to eompound a seientific name for an animal or plant, might surely
obtain the assistance of some more competent individual, if he find himself
under the necessity of imposing a name. As most yeneric denominations are
derived from the Greek, it follows, that it is principally words drawn from
that language, that, in the process of composition and reduction to the
Latin form, are most frequently subjected to barbarous misusage. Without

”Nomina generica ex vocabulo grzeeo et latino similibusque hybrida, non agno-
scenda sunt.” LmN„ Phil. bot„ ἓ 223. Conf. FABR., Phil. entom., ξ 18, p. 107.

”Nomina generica ex uno vocabulo plantarum generieo fracto, alio integro com-
posita, Botanicis indigna sunt.’' L1NN., Phil. bot., ξ 224. -— ”Per anagramma orta non

”Nomina barbara, quae quidam in Entomologia in novissimis temporibus intro-
duxerunt, omnino rejicienda, quum nullo modo intelligantur et difficile pronuntientur.”
FABR., Phil. Eut„ p. 109, ξ 24. — LmNE' even says that all generie names should be
rejected, ''quae a lingua graeea vel latina radicem non habent'’ (Phil. bot, ξ 229),
but he has not himself strictly adhered to this rule, and it would now be impossible
to get it aeknowledged and consistent-ly carried out.
