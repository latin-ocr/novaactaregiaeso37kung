14 T. TnoRELL,

exposing ourselves to the eharge of pedam-y, we may at least venture to
urge, with regard to them, the observance of the two following simple rules:
1.“’ If a nante be formed of two or more Greek words, these ovyht το be put
togyetlzer cceeordz'ny to tlte simple redes for tlte formation of Greek eompoundffl
and “2st When tlze Greek word is trcmsnznted into α Latin form, it ougylzt to
receive α Latin termination, and tlte Greek letters 0119111 to be replaced by such
Latin letters, as eorrespond to them, in tlte woo‘ks of Roman authors. 1)

Now since a great number of names are 111 this respect most erro-
neously formed, I consider it not only as a right, but as a duty to correct
them, e. g. 10 correct Uptz'oz‘es (from ῑῖηῃος) 10 IIyptiotes, llleyamyrmcekion
(μεγῑᾳιυρμκηκίον) to lllegyamyrmecium, zyptila 10 Omyptz'la, ΛΜΨ-ς 10 Areys,
Dez'nojn's to Dinopz's, and so forth. Such corrected names ought not to be
considered as neW, but to preserve their original rights, and be followed by
the name of the individual, as authority, who first formed the name. Even
names (at least generic names) formed of words taken from 011161Ζ61191α1963,
or ossen-oper verines, ought to be furnished with a Latin termination and, as far
as is possible, with a Latin orthography. Generic names of unknown or
uncertain etymology, but generally known and accepted, (e. g. Epez'ra, balistam,
Clubz'ona) must not be altered; and in general more freedom may be allowed
in the formation of generie than of (adJeetive) speeifie names,2) which
latter ought always to be in full eonformity with the rules of etymology.

With the help of the rules above stated Ι have here endeavoured to
fix the original speeifie names of number of spiders admitted into the works of
WEs'rfflNG, BLACKWALL, and Salon, as well as those of some other European
spiders known to me, and to correct such errors of synonymism as have
crept 11110 1116 works of these authors. Ar regards the ymera, I have 611-
deavoured to restore also to them their original denominations, where they
have been dispossessed by subsequent ones, as regards however the bozmds
and compat-s of the various genera, such difference of views prevails, that I
cannot of course hope to gain for my own opinions 011 11115 subject more
than a partia] assent. In the case of the familz'es, the law of priority is, as

1) ”Nomina generiea latinis literis pingenda sunt‘'. LINN., Phil. bot„ ξ 247.

”Sonus nominum, quantum fieri potest, facilitandus, ideoque nec graeca nee bar-
bara admittimus, et terminationem graecam in latinam mutamus& FABR.‚ Phil. ent.‚
p. 114‚§ 31.

2) We have accordingly, for example, preserved unaltered the termination in
Lathrodeetus (from λάθρᾳ and δήκτης) and Epesinus (ἐπισινής), though unquestionably
Lathrodeetes and Episz‘nes 15 1116 proper orthography3 neither have we adopted cor-
rections, Which would greatly alter the appearance of the word (e. g. Oops instead
of Oonops).
