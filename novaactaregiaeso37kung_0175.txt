is generally known, not applied, and Ι have accordingly, in conformity with
the practice of most modern arachnologists, adopted SUNDEVALL'S donomina-
tions, derived from the 111051 prominent genus within the family, cmploying
however the termination -οϊιῖιυ, as being more etymologically correct than -ἱ-
des or -idun — I have no doubt in many points been guilty of real mistakes,
but I venture nevertheless to hope for a mild judgement from persons acquaint-
ed with the subject, who are aware of the difficulties to be encountercd in a
work like the present. Ι ought especially to remark, that Ι have been un-
able to determine with certainty the exact date of the publication of some
of the arachnological works here cited, this has been especially the ease
111111 a eouple of works published in numbers without date, as also with some
papers published in periodieals. As regards these latter, Ι have in dubious
cases assumed the year for which the periodical is published, as the date of the
articles it contains, though in many instances this may not 110 right, because
the latter numbers of a journal commonly appear the year following. When
the year of a work's printing is expressed, I have of course accepted that
as the date of publication, whenever Ι did not know with certainty that
such date was incorrectly given 1).

In restoring the first or original specific names I have endeavoured
to observe all the cautiousness 50 necessary in such a process„ The speeies
of the older writers are, as is well known, often difficult, sometimes im-
possible to determine With certainty: with respect to them Ι have, in appli-
eable cases, laid it down as a rule to preserve tlte determinatione accepted
by modern arachozologsists who have lived in tlte country where the species
described< by the author in question have been collected. It is evident that a
French naturalist has the best opportunities for studying the Frenclz spiders
described by FOURCROY, DE Vrcnnns, LArRmLLE 010, a German the Ger-
man species of SCOPOLI, FABRICIUS and PANZER, and 50 forth, as also we
Swesles ought to be best acquainted with the Sweclz‘slz forms described by
CLERCK, LINNIJJ and DE GEER. Tradition has here a significancy that
must not be undervalued. It is only in cases in which Ι have supposed
myselt' able to show that an evident mistake has been made, that Ι have
deviated from this rule ²).

1) This is for instance the case with WALCKENAER'S Hist. Nat. d. Ins. Apt.‚
Tome II, which bears 01] its titlepage the date 1837, but did not come out till 1841.
2) Regarding the rules, which, in determining the species of the older authors,
ought in doubtful cases to 110 applied, Ι beg to cite the following from Ree. ern.
