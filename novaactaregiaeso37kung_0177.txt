In conformity with an alternative proposed by the British Committee,
Ι have, in this as well as in my previous works, in giving the authority
for a yenerz'c· meme, placed the author's name within parentlzeses whenever
the limits of the genus received by me are different from those of that
author, but without 2⁷)arentlzeses when the genus is considered as possessing its
original compass. If Ι wish to indicate that a genus ought to be taken in
the meaning proposed by some other particular author, Ι have usually
added the name of that author after that of the original describer. Thus
Epeira WALCK. signifies the genus Epeira as limited by WALCKENAER,
who first set up that genus. Epeira (VVALCK.) is the same genus, but with
different limits; Epeira (WALCK.) WESTR. (sometimes, but only for the sake
of brevity, Epeira WES'rR.) means the same genus with the limits assigned
to it by WEsrfflN-e.

After a complete name (including both the generic and speeific names)
the authority has been placed without parentheses, when the species occurs
under the same both generic and trivial name in the author cited, but
within parentheses, when the generic name used by him is different. I
write, for example, Epeira anyulata (CLERCK) with, but E. adianto XVALCK.
without parentheses. If a speeifie name appear to be not fully certain, Ι
have generally placed atter the authority cited for it the name of some
other author, in whose works it indicates the species Ι refer to. Em'gsone
ruflpes (Lm.) SUND. thus indicates the spider, which SUNDEVALL describes
as the Aranea rufipes of LINNE 1).

1) The ordinary custom in botanical workS, of appending as authority to the
complete name of a species the name of the author, who first employed the whole
name (both generic and speeifie), and of passing in silence over the writer, who
first made known the species, if he should have used another generie name, has
not been much followed by zoologists. What advantages that custom can offer, I am
unable to discover. By the opposite method of not-ation, adopted by me and by most
zoologists for indicating authorities, one obtains reference to the epoch, when the spe-
cies was first made known, and from which the priority of the name is to be reckoned,
and that is, Ι suppose, 16 most cases the main advantage gained by appending an
authority. This method does not of course prevent the citation of a later author
astera complete name, if the occasion be such as to require the making of a di-
stinction between his description or figures of the species and those of others. We
may accordingly very well speak e. g. of Epo-ira quadrata WESTR. and Epeira
quadrata Koon, though at the same time we assume, that the Epeion quadrata
of both these writers ought in strict propriety to be called Epeira quadrata (CLERCK).
