18 T. THORELL,

A † placed before a generic name indicates that the name, as being
previously engaged or found unsuitable for some other reason, has been
abandoned in favour of 501116 younger name, this mark, when placed before
the complete name of a speeies⁷ has the same signification with respect
to the specific name.

A date placed after a generie name indicates the year, in which
that genus was made known and defined3 after a complete or speciflc name
it has the same signification With respect to the specific name. The addition
of these dates to the names I look upon as of the greatest utility for
preserving the proper denominations of the various species.

Instead 01 settiug forth the observations I have thought fit to make
on the yenera (and families) recognized by our three authors, in the order
in which they appear in their works here referred to, and mixed with dis-
(111151110115 respecting the species, I have preferred to treat these larger groups
separatety. I have therefore first made up a systematical list or review of
the sub-orders, families, sub-families and genera of European Spiders recog-
nized by me. Each generic name is accompanied by the name of the
author, who first published it, and the year when this took place; more-
over by its etymological derivation, its synonyms, and the name of the

and critical remarks as I have thought appropriate. In almost all the
genera which I have had the opportunity of examining, Ι 113176 subjoined a
short description of the form and armature of the tarsal and palpal claws,
which organs have not yet attracted all the notice they appear 10 deserve 1).
— To this list, When in going through our authors, I have 601116 upon the
different genera, I have always subsequently referred.

Under the head of each family I have introduced a short account
of the characteristics of the sub-families and genera it comprises. These
characteristics Ι have endeavoured as far 35 possible to derive from the
number and position 01 1116 eyes and the form of the organs of the mouth,
partly because such distinctive features are easily verified, partly because
they are most generally (often too exelusively) used, at least in determining
the limits of the 'qenerz‘c groupS. But Ι 113176 3150 endeavoured to make
use of the different form and number of the spinners, of differences in the
conformation of the cephalothorax and abdomen, in the relative lengths and
