armature of the legs, the number of claws 011 the tarsi, etc. Genera, which
rest exclusively on such characteristies as belong only to one sem, leaving
the other undetermincd, I have not adopted, but consider that they ought
to be unreservedly rejected. I ought to call especial attention to the cir-
cumstance, that exotio forms have not been taken into consideration in the
formation of these schematic reviews, which accordingly ean be used as a
clcw in classifying such speeies only, as belong to the Em‘opeccn fauna.
The characteristics of the sub-orders, as they cannot be expressed in few
words, and indeed may be considered as generally known, I have not thought
it necessary to repeat, but refer for them to e. g. LATREILLE'S, SUNDEVALIJS,
WEsrmNG’s and OHLER'r's works.

In the catalogue of araclmzoloyz‘eal litterature, with which I have
opened this treatise, I have included all the works known to mc on new
exz'stz'ny European spiders, of a descriptiva, systematical and eoo-qeogsraplzz'cal
character, with the exception however of such writings as belong to the
prce-Linmean period, of which only a small number of works, referred
to in the following pages, have been admitted. lVorks belonging to that
period, among which I also reckon writings of later date, in which LINNE'S
binominal system is not fully adopted, are in the list marked with a †.
Moreover for reasons, that are easily understood, zoological handbooks and
compendia, in which no new facts relating to our subjectare communicated,
have been excluded. Of works which as regards spiders contain only no-
tiees of their anatomy, economy etc., Ι have taken into my list only those,
which Ι have occasion in this work to cite, and they are distinguished
from others by their titles being included in brackets []. Of the littera-
ture that treats exclusively of motio spiders, I have similarly admitted
only such works, as Ι had occ-asion to cite. Their titles are printed in
smaller types. Some of the works in the catalogue Ι have not myself had
the opportunity of consulting3 these are marked with an asterisk, and
whenever Ι have been obliged to quote such a work, I have always indica-
ted the source from which Ι have derived the citation ¹).

Before proceeding to the special examination of the three works
before us, Ι ought perhaps to give a short general account of each of them.

1. XVESTRING⁷S Araneoe Suecz'cae contains complete and accurate

descriptions of 308 species of Spiders found in Sweden and Norway, of
which 34 belong to the family Epeiridoe, 115 to Thaidem, 63 to Drassidoe‚
