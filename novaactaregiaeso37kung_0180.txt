3O to wzomz'sidoe, 35 to Lycosidoe and 31 to Atridae. Not only the specieS‚
but also the genera and families are in this work characterized in detail:
by this the author has been enabled to avoid the error of taking up in the
description of the species a number of distinctive marks common to whole
series of species, an error, which makes the descriptions given by sundry
other writers so deficient in characteristics, in spite of their often wearisome
prolixity. VVESTRING has succeeded in finding sharp and certain distinctive
marks sor the species he describes: we would especially call attention to
the excellent characters he has discovered in the different number and di-
stribution of the spines on the extremities. Equally important are the di-
stinguishing features pointed out by WESTRING in his detailed descriptions
of the males* palpi: nor has he quite overlooked the circumstance, that
similar sharp characteristics may be found by studying the external sexual
organs of the females. What immediately strikes a reader on looking
into WVESTRING'S book, is the singular diligence and conscientiousness that
it evinces: his descriptions have not been made independently of each other,
they have not been written down once for all as the different species came
under the author’s eye, but they are the result of most accurate and many
times repeated comparisons of the various species 1), They have thus become

1) WESTRING’S rigorons comparative treatment of the Swedish spiders has been
considerably facilitated by the method in which his collection of spiders is preserved.
He does not preserve his spiders in spirits, but impaled upon pins, after having first
been dried by a process invented by himself and described with full details in his
paper: '’Anvisning att andamalsenligt insamla och conservera Arachnider, for-namh-
gast med afseende {⁰1 spindlarne.'' We shall very briefly describe this method, which
it is true at first seems difficult and tediouS, bnt which one, after a little practice,
finds as easy as it is appropriate. It is a characteristic of the method that the
spider's abdomen, and that part 072ng of ist body, is hardenecl by heat. The following
simple instruments are required for the operation: 120, a glass cylinder of about 11⁰
01· 1¹s2³¹¹ diam. and about 45¹¹ long, one end of which is closed with a cork: in this
cylinder the spiders abdomen is hardened over the flame os a candle3 2:o, a small
and very fine pair of 50155015, as also a stronger and coarser pair: with the former
the abdomen is cut off, with the latter the pin, which is used as a spit, sszo, a little
cylindrical shaft encircled at the one end by a cylindric metal ring filled vvith a
cork, in which eorl< the spit is fastened during the operation3 420, a fine pair of
twcezers, and a few small slices os eorl< about 2 111105 thick, insect-pins, blotting-
paper, and a lighted candle. When the spider has been in a proper manner killed
(e. g. by vapour of ether 01· by heat) it is to be impaled on an appropriate insect-
pin passed through the right side of the cephalothorax3 the abdomen is then cut off
(the animal being holden in the half-closed left hand, in which the abdomen, on
being separated, falls) close to the cephalothorax‚ and the incision is dried with blot-
