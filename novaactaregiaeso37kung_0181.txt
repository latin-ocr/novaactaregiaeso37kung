strictly eonzparatae, a quality wc do not often meet with in the dcscriptions
of this group of animals3 and we probably do not say too much when we
assert7 that NVESTRING surpasses all his predecessors in the accuraey and
sharpness of his descriptions, and that 1115 work, in its descriptive character
— if we overlook the occasionally somewhat lengthey diagnoscs ¹) —— may
be considered as a model for those who come after him.

 

ting-paper. The head of another inseet-pin of about the same substance having been
cut off, the blunt end is introduced into the severed abdomen (through the opening
caused by the abscission) up to the spinners, and is fastened by its point into the
above-named shaft. By holding the pin a moment in the flame of the light, the
abdomen is easily made to sit fast upon the little spit. The glass cylinder is then
taken in the left hand and holden horizontally over the 113111ος with the right band
the spider's abdomen is introduced into the open end of the cylinder, and holden
there immediately over the flame. In consequence of the heating os the air in the
cylinder‚ the abdomen is gradually hardened, under which process it must be turned
on all sides and brought nearer to or removed farther from the heated glass as
occasion may require3 but care must be taken not to employ too great a heat, as
the abdomen would then be burncd or crack⁷ nor too small a 11031, 35 the skin
would in that 0350 wrinkle and collapse. One⁴ must every now and then try with
a fine needle whether the abdomen be everywhere firm so as not to yield to pressure:
and the hardening process must be continued till this is the case. The pin (spit)
15 now cut off obliquely (so as not to be too blunt), at such distance, that a portion
of about ³!ae the length of the cephalothorax 15 left standing out from the abdomen.
By means of the tweezers this portion of the pin fixed in the abdomen 15 introduced
into the cephalothorax through the opening made by clipping the petiolum. When
the abdomen and cephalothorax have been thus reunited, and placed in their natural
position, the pin for monnting the spider is stnck perpendicularly into a slice of
cork, so that the spider remains at a short distance from the cork3 the legs are
extended and fastened by means of pins 111 their natural position (as in the speci-
mens in my collection), or else somewhat bent under the body (as in WESTMNG'S
collection, in which case they are not so easily broken off); in this condition the
animal must remain in a dry place, until the cephalothorax and legs are completely
dry, when it is ready to be placed in the collection. Spiders thus prepared are as
easily and conveniently examined as insects impaled in the usual manner3 but if
one has besides a collection in spirits, so much the better. Very few speeies (e. g.
some of the genus Xysticns) lose a little of their 0010111· in hardening: nearly all
others, if rightly manipulated, remain entirely unehanged.

1) Originally diagnosis was looked upon as synonymous with ”differentia speci-
fica'', i. 0. 3 definition comprising the marks necessary and sufficient to distinguish
the species from all other species belonging to the same genus. But such a definition
is possible only when all the species of the genus are known, which is far from
being always the case: and, in the case of genera containing many 51100105, at any
rate such definitions would mostly 110 too long to be of any great 111-3011031 utility.
