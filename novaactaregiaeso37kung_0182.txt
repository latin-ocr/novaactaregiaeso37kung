Τ. ΤΗΟΒΕΕΕ,

VVESTRING has throughout consistently endeavoured to apply the law
01 1115 1111011117 01 11511155, and it is therefore only in consequence 01 1115 1101
having had access to certain porticus of arachnological litterature, that he
has⁷ instead of the oldest and therefore right names, occasionally used
newer appellations, not only for a number of 51155155, 11111 even for certain
genera. But to this we shall have occasion hereaftcr to return.

The remarks we have to make against WVESTRING'S work are not
many. It may 115 mentioned as an impcrfection, that the author has paid
no attention 10 111055 5115155151151155, 1115 examination 01 which requires the
aid of the microscope, and some of which, e. g. those derived from the
structure of the spinners and the claws, are by no means unimportant
either in classification or specific description. A somewhat more detailed
account of the (1111515111 species' 01 spiders 05511151155, 55011011117, industry, etc.‚
than what the author has furnished‚ would have been acceptable⁷ and might
also certainly by him, who for 50 long a series 01 years has devoted his
attention to that group 01 5111111515, easily have been supplied.

As regards the fcmzvilies into which WEsTRmG has distributed the
Swedish spiders, they are, as corresponding with the Latreillean family-
groups (by me considered as sub-orders) very natural, but might perhaps at
least in part be resolved with advantage into several, as is particularly
the case with the Drassidae XVESTR„ which most modern authors divide into
three or more separate families. With regard to the division of the families
into syenem the author appears in general 10 have hit upon the right mean
course between too strict an adherence to the views 01 older systematizers and
the 0555510115111Γ over minute subdivision 01 genera, such as has been introdu-
ced into the territory 01 araclmology by for instance MENGE3 nevertheless it
appears 10 115, 11151 501115 01 1115 older genera preserved uuchanged by
VVESTRING, e. g. Uzerz'diwn, Ρήἱῖοεῖνωηπε, Lycmon, Attus, might well have
borne with some division⁷ as well as Epeirm CIubiona, 19155353, etc, which
he has divided into several smaller generic groups.

To facilitate comparison between the Spider-fauna of the Scandina-
vian peninsula and that of Οτι-551 Britain and Ireland⁷ as they appear in the

We accordingly find in descriptive works 01 moderate bulk the diagnoses generally
so expressed, that they serve to distinguish only those 51155155 01 1115 genus, that
are immediately under treatment, and have therefore no other object than to facili-
tate tlte determination of an unknown specie& But for that purpose —- the only One
Which in a diagnosis needs be considered — it needs not be very verbose, not
even in very large genera, if nota bene these genera are duly subdivided into smal-

ler easily distinguishable groups.
