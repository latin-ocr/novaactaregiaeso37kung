A glauce at the foregoing table shows, what is remarkable enough,
that the number of species of spiders observed in Sweden ans] Nor-
way >on the one side and Great Britain and Ireland on the other is very
nearly the same, a little above 300. As however the last mentioned coun-
tries7 from their more southerly position and warmer climate, ought pro-
bably to possess a richer spider—fauna than our peninsula, one may perhaps
asssume, that this latter has been more carefully scrutinized with respect
to its arachnology than the British Isles, where accordingly a rich after-
harvest of new species probably remains to be made. ³)

The number of species that compose the different families‚ is 011 the
contrary very unlike within the faunistic districts in question. The Thera-
plzosoz'doe (Mygyalz'dae BLACKW.)‚ which in Englancl are represented by Aty-
pus piceus, are altogether absent from Scandinavia. Unless we aggregate
Plzolcus to the Scytodoz'dae, that family is also unrepresented in Scandinavia.
While WESTRING has in his leerz'diz'dae (leerz'dioz‘doe -1- chstodoidoe NOB.)

1) Dolomedes in BLACKWALL comprehends 3 species.

2) Saltieus in BLACKWALL comprehends 17 species.

3)1n some papers that have since appeared, OAMBMDGE and BLACKWALL
have indeed considerably augmented the number of known spiders in these islands.
In Sweden also several new forms have in the meantime been observed, but not
yet publishedj3 some of these we shall have occasion in the following pages to mennon.
