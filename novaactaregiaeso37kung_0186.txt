26 Τ. THORELL,

but 115 species, BLACKWALL has described 144 species of the same family
01· rather sub-order — 145, if we consider Scytodes as belonging to the The-
riclz'idae WESTR. It is the genera Linyphz'a and Eriyone alone (comprehending
together 112 species in BLACKWALL and but 83 in W‘ESTRING) that deter-
mine that family’s great preponderance in the British compared with the
Scandinavian fauna. On the other hand Lycosz'cloe and Attidae are far more
numerous here than within the boundaries of Britain, the first of these fa-
milies showing 35 to 20, the latter 31 to 18 species, of the genus Lycosa
WESTRING takes up double as many (32) species as BLACKWALL, of Attus

nearly double (30 to 16).

The families Epeirz'doe, Brassidce and leomz'sz'dce of VVESTRING are
about equally numerously represented in both countries. As regards his Dras-
sz'doe (Tabitelarz‘ce NOB.) it should however be observed that, whereas the
yenm'ne Drassidae (Drassoz‘doe ΝΟΒ.) are far more numerous in our country
(41 to 29 species — Sparassus being referred to the Thonzisoz'dce, Aywem,
Aryyroneta and the C'z‘nift'om'doe BLACKW. to the Ayalenoz'dce —), the number Of
species of the Dysderoidae and Aqalenoz'doe is not so great in the Scandina-
vian peninsula as in Great Britain and Ireland (the respective proportions being
3 to 7 and 17 to 22).

Among the forms described by BLACKWALL, we find several belong-
ing also to the southern and middle parts of the European continent, which
are entirely absent here: such for ex. are Uloborus lVachcenaerz‘i LATR. (Ve-
leda lineata BLACKW.), Scytodes thomcz'ca, Seyestrz'a florentina, Dysdera
pzmctorz'a, Coelotes samtilz's, Eresus cimzaberinus and Atypus piceus. Resides
Ulolmrm, Scytodes, Coeloz‘es‚ Ereszcs and Αΐῃμιε, the genera Oonops and
schaenobates of the family Dysclwoz'doe, (each of one specIes), are entirely
unrepresented in the Scandinavian peninsula, whereas again - since Hyptiotes
(Makras) paracloms has been found in Englandl), and if we have been
right in referring BLACKWALL'S Ayelena ,oracilipes and celans to Apostenus
WESTR. — all the genera that occur in our country have their representatives
in the fauna of Great Britain and Ireland.

Among the species common throughout a great part of Sweden, but
which seem to be absent in Great Britain and Ireland, we mention (by the
names given them in WESTRING's work) the following: Zilia montana, The-
ridium castaneum, albo-maculatum, [Uelcmopkora nocturna, Philodromus mar—
yarz'tatus, formicinus, Lycosa nemoralis, monticola, tear-salis, Zz'ynaria, paludi—
cola, toem'ata, cuneata, Attus hastatus, medius, v-z'nsz'ym'tus and arcuatus.
