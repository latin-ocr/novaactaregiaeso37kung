ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 27

2. ”A Historgl <37⁶ tlte Spiders qf Great Britain and Ireland, by
John Blackwall'', (Part Ι. 1861, Part ΙΙ. 1864),16 1116 11116 of the second of
the works with the examinatiou of which we are occupied. The work is
published by T he Ray Socffly, and is a costly work, a small folio, with
384 pages of text and 29 coloured plates. The author, who has long borne
611 honoured name among the zoologists of the present age, has not only
by numerous essays of a descriptive character on the order of spiders,
but also by important discovcries relative to these animals’ economy, their
industry and their (outward) structure, laid this branch of zoology under
great obligations. Since however the greatest part of BLACKWALL’S pre-
vious works are scattered over a series extending to many years of
English Ι1011111616 61111 other periodical works, they 616 1101 60 easily or
generally accessible as were to be desired, and accordingly several of the
continental arachnologists seem not to be aware of them. We are therefore
60 11111011 1116 111016 thankful for the work before 116, which unites to 6 whole
111 611 independent treatise and worthily completes the author’s 111-6110116
labours in illustrating the spider-fauna of Great Britain and Ireland.

As we have already 66611 (p. 25), 11116 work contains descriptions
of 304 species, distributed into the following 12 families: sllyyalidoe (1 spe-
cies) Lycosidce (21), Saltioz'doe (18), ἸῚιοηιὶεἱᾱω (29), Drassz'dce (27), Cini-
flonz'doe (9), Ayelenidoe (15), leerz'clz'idoe (28), Linyphz'idoe (116), Epeirz'dae (32),
Dysderidae (7) 0011 Scytodz'dce (1). It 16 preceeded by an introduction, in
which the author gives 6 611011 general account of the external and 1111611161
structure of the spiders, their economy, the construction of their webs and
their manner of living, which is 60 11111011 1116 111016 valuable, as being found-
ed on BLACKWALL'S own observations and discoveries.1) This 16 perhaps
the ground on which the respected author labours with most success: as 6
systematizer he does not appear to us to be always quite so fortunate. We
cannot, for example, accept the author's method, proposed by him 111 1841 2),
61111 611106 111611 constantly maintained, of dividing the spiders into 3 tribes

1) BLACKWALn seems not to have witnessed a peculiarly important fact ascer—
tained many years ago by MENGE (Ueb. die Lebensw. d. Aracha, p. 36), viz. that
the male spider, before the act of copulation, emits from the sexual aper-ture situated
under the base of the abdomen, a drop of sperma on a kind of small web made for
the purpose, which drop he then takes up in the genital bulb of the palpi. This
process has newly been observed also by AUSSERER (Beob. iiber die Lebensw. der
Spinnen, pag. 194 et sequ.)
