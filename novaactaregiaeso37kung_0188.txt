with 6, and Binoeulz‘nae with 2 eyes ¹). Now not only is a fourth tribe
wanting for the spiders, which have no eyes, as e. g. &alita SCHIoDTE and
Hadites KEYSERL., of which genera the first is nearly connected with
Dysdem and the other is, so to say, a blind Agazenffi but this whole sy-
stem of classification lies open to the objection, that it is entirely artificia&
By a one-sided adherence to a single feature not correlated with an aggre-
gate of characters or intimately affecting the whole organism of the animal,
nearly related forms are, as is well known, almost always widely sundered,
and others, which are really far removed from one another, united in the
same division, — and this is also the case when spiders are grouped ac-
cording to the number of their eyes. As proof of this assertion we need
110 more than to referto the genera Plzolous and Spermoplzora (Rachus),
of which the former has 8, and the latter 6 eyes. One species of the last
named genus was first described by DUGES ²) under the name of Phole-us
senoculatus, and is in fact so like a Plzolcns, that WALOKENAER doubted the
correctness of DUGES' statement as to the number of the animal's eyes, nor
was it until LUCAS 3) also had found a six-eyed Pholcus, (Ph. 4-pzmctatus
LUC.‚ no doubt identical with the Pholczcs senoculatus)‚ and thus confirmed
DUGES’ report, that WALGKENAER formed for these animals the genus Ra-
clms 4). The North American Spermoplzora (Oophora) meridionalis described
by HENTZ 5) 15 said also to differ from Pholcus only in having 6 eyes and

1) WALCKENAER also has made use ofthe number of eyes as a basis of classifi-
cation: he however first separated ”les Theraphoses'’ (Mygalidae) from other spiders
(³⁷les A1·aignees⁷'), and then divided (as early as 1833) these others into two divisions,
spiders with 6 and spiders with 8 eyes (Mem. sur une nouv. classis. d. Aran., p. 438).
When he afterwards became acquainted with the 2-eyed genus Nops MAG LEAY, a
third division was added for its accommodation, so that in WALOKENAEffs Ins.Apt.,
II, p. 510, 51] (1841) we find ”les araignees’⁷ divided into ”les Binocule'es, les Sd-
noculdeff’ and ”les Octocule'es.⁷⁷ - Whether any 4-eyed spiders exist, is uncertain: the
Tessarops maritima ΚΛΜΝ, which is said to be distinguished by that unusual num-
ber of eyes, is so ill described and drawn, that one cannot feel certain even that
this animal is a spider at all. (Conf. RAFINESQUE‚ Descript. d'une araignee qui oon-
