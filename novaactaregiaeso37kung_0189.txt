shorter legs 1). Even in BLACKWALL’S works the mischievous consequences
of the artificial, even if in other rcspects convenient⁷ system by him adop-
ted are clearly visible: Segyestrz'a and Dysdera are widely separated from
the Drassiclce‚ their nearest relations, and placed next to Scytocles‚ the
natural place of which is surely in the neighbourhood of Pholcus, and which
is more nearly related to BLACKWALL'S Thericlz'idoe, than to any other of
his families. —- BLACKWALL appears to us also to lay too much weight upon
an organ which he considers as a 4²¹· pair of spinners grown together, and
011 the rows of eurved hairs or bristles on the metatarsi of the posterior
legs, which hc calls calamistrum: on the always contemporaneous presence
of these organs be has based his family Cinfflonz'che, in which he brings to-
gether forms so widely separated as e. g. Anzsmrobias (Cinlflo BLACKW.)
and Uloborns (Veleda BLACKW.), the former of which genera 15 usually
aggregated to the Tubioelae of LATREILLE and the latter to his Orbitelae.
The genera Eresus ancl Dinopz's‚ which also, as L. KOCH has shown 2),
have the '’calamistrzmff' and the above mentioned organ situated immediately
under or in front of the spinners (and which we on account of its situation
call the i}fita-mammilla& mycen), 3) must thus also be referred to the family
Cimflom'clae, which accordingly is made to contain a heterogeneous mixture
of species belonging 10 the most widely separated families 4). However
important these characters may be — and we believe that we attribute 10

among the Retitelarz'ae (Inceqzffiteloe) not only Spermophorcc, but also sicarius WALCK.
or Thomisoides NICOLET (if this genus really belong 10 that sub-order and not, as is
more probable, to the Thomisoidae) has also only six eyes. KEMPELEN has lately
(Vei-handl. 11. zool.-bot. Vereins in Wien, XVII) described under the name of legsscc
pyth07zz'ssaef0rmz's a six-eyed spider from Hungary, which seems 10 be nearly connected
with the genus Gnaplzosa (Pytlzonissa C. KocH) belonging to the real Drassoiclae.

3) L. KOCH (Die Arachn-gatt. Amaurobius7 Coelotes u. Oybaeus, p. 1) provi-
sionally calls this organ eriballum, because he finds that it has some likeness to a
sieve (’⁷Sieb¹'). The name ⁷'Sieb’‘‚ colatorium, has been previously employed by MENGE
for the surface of the last joint of the spinners where the spinning-tubes are situated:
