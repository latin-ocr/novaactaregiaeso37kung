them sufficient weight, when we set up for the forms which exhibit them,
within the family Epeiroidoe the sub-family Uloborz'Jeoe, and within the family
Ayalfflwz'dae the sub-family Amaurobinzoe‚ and moreover among the Saltim-adse
reckon the Eresoz'doe and Dinopoz‘cloe as separate families, —- they cannot
be allowed the importance which BLACKWALL ascribes to them. In the first
place it is very uncertain, that the organ, which BLACKWALL considers as
a pair of spinners grown together, really is so, I for my part do not think
so, for it does not project above the surface of the abdomen, but seems
only to consist of a peculiarly modified part of the skin, neither have Ι
been able to discover any spinning-tubes 011 its surface 1). But evenis
BLACKWALL'S explanation of that organ is right, still the family Mygyalidae
BLACKW. proves, that the number of spinners needs not be the same 111 all
the genera belonging to one and the same family3 for to that family BLAOK-
WALL himself reckons genera not only with four but also with six spinners.
As regards the calamismmz, the purpose of that apparatus 111 the animal's
economy is perhaps as yet too little known to justify the laying of any
great weight upon it in classification. If BLACKWALL'S statement, that it is
a curling-apparatus used in the construction of the spider's weh, 2) is cor-
rect as regards the genera Annam-obius and Didyma, which I have 110 rea-
son to doubt, it can hardly have the same functions in, for ex„ the species
of Uloborus and Hyptiotes (ssfflhms), which weave regular, so-called geo-

 

 

 

1) It is a matter (leserving of investigation, whether the infra-mamillary organ be
not connected with traeheoe, having their stigmata in or close to that organ. That
some spiders (Dysderoz'dce, Aryyroneta) have two tracheal trunks opening on the
ventral sursace of the abdomen, near its base, behind the openings of the two so-
called pulmonary sacs, is generally known. In some other species MENGE (Ueb. d.
Lebensweise d. Arachn„ p. 233 Preuss. Spinnen, p. 81, 189 ete.) has discovered a
system of tracheae opening at the end of the abdomen, immediately z'n front of the
spinners, with either two stigmata (certain Attoiclce and the Eriffone- and Walclce-
mcera— or sllicrypltcmtes-species) or only one (Ceo-cirita or Cerceis prominens). But
according to v. SOEBOLD (Vei-gl. Anatom„ p. 535) there is in most spiders — he
reckons up the different genera Epez'ra, Tetmymffla, Thericlion, Drassus, Οἷῑιόἰοηα,
Lycoscz, Dolomecles, leomz’sus (A'ystz'cus) — a flssure before the spimzers, from
which proceed four flattened, hand-formed, almost always unramified tracheae. It
seems then that a tracheal system is to be found iu all spiders provided with only
two ⁷⁷pulmonary” sacs, although it may terminate sometimes with one and sometimes
vvith two very variously situated apertur-es, and it is certainly not wanting in those
genera, which have an infra-mamillary organ and calamistrum.
