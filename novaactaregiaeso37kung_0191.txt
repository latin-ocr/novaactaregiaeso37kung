metrieal webs3 and as a calamistrum is found in spiders, whose industry is
so different, it appears to us that it‘s importancc in the construction of the
wcb cannot always be particularly great.

The 12 families adopted by BLACKWALL all constitute natural groups,
with the exception of the C'inifionz'doe, of which we have already spoken,
and in some degree the leerz'clz'z'zlce, which family 111 BLACKWALL comprises
only the lValekenaerian genera T lzerz'dizmz and Ptolem,- for the remaining
genera of SUNDEVALL’S T lzerz'dz‘des he has formed the family Linyplzz'z'doe.
This division of the old family Theridicles is certainly unuecessary: BLACK-
WALL does not mention a single character of the animals themselves, whereby
the families may 116 distinguished. Plzolezcs appears to us rather to belong
to the Septodordae, and that family should immediately follow 1116 Theridio-
Tdae. -— The 1311111166 316 very briefly, often insufficiently or 1101 31 all,

BLACKWALL, as regards the number and extent 01 1116 genera he
adopts, is much more conservative than WESTRING3 he acknowledges but
a small number of new generic groups over and above those already
established by WALCKENAER, like whom, in determining the limits 01 the
genera, he appears to fix his attention almost exclusively 011 1116 611313616-
1161166 01 the organs of the mouth, the position of the eyes, and the rela-
tive length of the legs. The greatest part of the genera proposed by others,
for ex„ O. KOCH, and the distinctions of which are founded also on charae-
teristics deduced from other parts of 1116 body, are rejected by BLAOKWALL,
although they, if often in a more or less modified form, appear to have
been pretty generally acknowledged by the araclmologists of the Continent.

The author's remarks on the instincts, haunts and general eeonomy
01 1116 species described, their manner 01 constructing their webs ete, are
particularly valuable and interesting. The descriptions 01 1116 speeies are
themselves, with few exceptions, very fully detailed, and, in combination
with the figures, sufficient for the recognition of the species. Especial
attention has been very properly paid to the form 01 1116 palpi of the males, to
the construction 01 1116 spinners and other finer details of structure, except
as regards the spinas wherewith the legs and palpi are armed‚ which are
only superficially touched upon. The descriptions are however often oecu-
pied in a great measure by characters, which, as common for the whole
genus or most 01 1116 species comprised by it, are of little or no 1166 111
determining the species. We wish to call attention to this as an impedi-
ment in the use of the work, as also, and that especially, to the absence <ff
