parately gives any hints as to the characters by which the 01100100 111001
resembling each other may best be distinguished. The ‘unit of Zenyth for

very well chosen. Instead of stating, as most zoologists do, the size of

111000 1111110, BLACKWALL measures the length and breadth of the spider‘s
cephalothorax, abdomen etc. by fractions of an inch difficult to compare,
so that one is sometimes obliged to submit the given measure to an arith-
metical reduction, before it is possible to form a clear idea of the relative
size of the parts described. — The figures are, with a few exceptions,
(as e. g. some in Pl. I and II) good. Not only are coloured entire figures
01 both the male and female of almost every 01100100 given, but also outli-
nes 01 1110 111010’0 1101111, frequently also of the position of the eyes, the diffe-
rent organs 01 1110 111011111, and 00 forth. The large and difficult genera
Neriene and Walclcenaera (= Ενῑζᾳοηε WESTR.) are treated with 001100101
0010, 01111 indeed there scarcely exists in arachnological literature anything
surpassing the superb, highly magnified figures, that BLACKWALL 1100
furnished of these remarkable little spiders.

BLAOKWALL in his synonyms cites but few arachnological works3
excepting his countryman 111οΤΕο 110 mentions 110110 01 1110 older authors,
non even CLERCK or FABRICIUS: he generally follows, and only with a too
implicit confidence, the determinations and nomenclaturc of WALCKENAER.
Accordingly, as we shall 1101001101 000, 1110 specific names will 110 frequently
obliged 10 give place 10 011101, older denominations. In other respects he
appears in his nomenclature 10 have conscientiously observed the law
of priority.

is a work differing in many respects from the two preceeffing, and which
we here submit 10 examination only 011 account of the '’Cataloque synony-
mique des espbces em⁴0pe‘emzes⁷⁷ appended 10 11. The work contains a descrip-
tion of the internal and externa] structure of spiders, followed by a detailed
account 01 their division into families, sub-families and genera, a list of
the species belonging to each separate genus, as also an account 01 1110
1111110111οΙ species' haunts and economy. The plan and object of the work
are clearly set forth by the author in the following words: ’'resumer . . .
