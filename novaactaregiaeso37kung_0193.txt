vWe arc however afraid that the author has not executed his work with
sufficient care and accuracy to be said to have solved so comprehen-
sive a 111-01116111 ina satisfactory manner: 116 does not even possess the
acquaintance with arachnologieal literature indispensably necessary fora
work of this nature 1>. Accordingly a very large number both of genera
and species made known before the publication of SIMON’S work by
German, English, American, Swedish and other authors, are 111 that
work wanting.

SIMON divides the spiders into 9 families: Scytodzformes‚ lllgsyalg'for-
mes, Drassg‘fhrmes, T heffidfformes, Epe'z‘rz‘sbrmes, Salticzj‘brmes, Lycosg‘sbv’iwves,
Thomz'sz'formes and lllyrme‘cg'formes. The first of these families, 803110(Ζὶ-
formes, includes the genera Scytala, 0111051163, Eadm, Plzolcus and Arteman,
which union appears to us fully justified. On the other hand the combination
of two so widely different generic forms as Illyrmecium and Chersis (Palpi-
mamzs) 111 1116 family stlyrme'cfformes‚ does not appear to be a happy step,
nor does the union of Ayeleaidae BLACKW. with Theridz'des SUND. to 0116 fa-
mily, ledrz'dfformes, seem more reasonable. Ayalenoz’doe and Therz'dz‘oz'doe
are by SIMON not even separated as svrcb-famz'lz'es or tribes: when break-
ing up his sl'lze'ridzjbrmes into 3 such divisions (Olotlze‘z'ens, Thebaidem,
and Lz‘nyplziens), 116 removes 6. g. the genera Linyphz'a and fllicryphaoztes
from his The'ricliens (leeridz'mm Erigyone, etc.) and unites them with the
Ayalenoidae in the sub-family Linyphz‘ens. — Whether SIMON has been right
in removing Eresus from the Anides SUND. and aggregating that genus to
his Epe'z'rzj‘brmes, it must also be permittes] to doubt.

Most of the 93 ymera adopted by SIMON appear to 116 founded in
nature; indeed they correspond, with the exception of Ooeypz‘ila (for leomz'-
sus clamatus WALCK.) and le‘ynoz‘des (for T h. ruyosus WALCK. and Th.

ed to give a brief account of the development of arachnology: thus for ex.‚ having

des Inseotes”, which treats of spiders, in 1778. The works in question were then by
no means published, as SIMON states, nearly at the same time, hut during the course
of three successive eenturies.
