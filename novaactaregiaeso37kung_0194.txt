But if at first sight the number of genera adopted by SIMON appears not
to be unreasonably great, but rather the reverse, the fact is nevertheless
otherwise. Instead of dividing every family or sub-family into a number
of groups comparable with each other, viz. the plenem, and merely applying
to these a generic name, he has followed the altogether objectionable exam-
ple set by some authors, of forming so-called sub-yerz.era,- and not content
with dividing a large number of genera into ''sous-yenres” with separate
names, he goes farther and divides these ”sous-genres'' into ''yroupes'', also
loaded with names of a similar kind, whereby the number of generic
names used by 81111οΝ becomes very considerable. The ''sous-genres” and
'’groupes⁷' are often very vaguely distinguished, and the characters attri-
buted' both to them and to the genera properly so called, nay even to the
families themselves, are in general by no means trustworthy and indeed

not unfrequently erroneous. 1)
SIMON has endeavoured to give the etymologica] derivation of every

generic name3 his services however in this respect are greatly depreciated

1) This may be sufficiently shown by a couple of examples. Of the family
chftocliformes it is said (p. 43), that their physionomy has ”quelque chose de parti-
(mlier, qui est du ἐι la forme ylobzdeuse da σονεεῖθὺ, &leves sico-tout en arria-&⁷ eto. But Of
the genera belonging to that family, chstodes is the only one to which this description
is applicable3 for Omosz'tes 1135 the cephalothorax ”deprime'' and Radius has its
”parties laterales et posterieures deprimees’'‚ Pliolcus has it ''dep1·ime”‚ and Artenia
”deprime en 31·1·101’0”, according to SIMON⁷s own account. — According to SIMON
(p. 256) the genus Sinqa differs from Epeira ”par une forme particuli‘ere et characte-
ristique de l'abdomen3 . . . . il s’eleve et s'elargit graduellement jusqu⁷a sa partie
posterieure, dont la portion superieure est un tubercule et dont la portion inferieure
est tronquee obliquement’⁷—-a description which may very well suit for S. conica (which
however Wsssmme and MENGE, as it seems to us with good reason, do not aggre-
gate 10 1110 genus δῖηρα), 11111 which is quite inapplicable to e. g. S. hamata, which
is typical of the genus, as well as to S. H'erz'i and othe1·s.-Epeio’ca nzarmorea and
pyramidata (scalaris), Which are perfectly similar both in form and economy, and
distinguished only by colour, are referred by SIMON to different '’groupes'’ of the
”sub-genus⁷' Epeion.- the former is a Neopora Sm„ which group is said (p, 261) to have
the abdomen ''globuleux faiblement anguleux”, and the species of which are ''araignees
vivant . . . dans les jardins, ne construisant pas de coques⁷', whereas the last
belongs to the group Neoschoena [Neoscomc] Sur, the species of which have the
abdomen ’'tout-a-fait globuleux et oviforme’', and are ''araignees vivant sur les bords
des caux, se renfermant dans des coques'' etc. -— The sub-genera, into which the
genus Allioryplzantes 15 subdivided, are distinguished by characters belonging only to 0110
sex, and one of them, Valerius 81111, 15 characterized (p. 196> by a peculiarity ('’les deux
