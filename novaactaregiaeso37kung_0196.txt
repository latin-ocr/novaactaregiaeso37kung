3ss T. THORELL,

and Attus WALCK.), of which, as is well known, the first name has long
belonged to a Hemipterous, and the last two again to two Hymenopterous
genera ¹). The names which through these aud similar alterations have
come into SIMON'S work, I have not, in the giving of synonyms and deter-
minations of priority, considered myself bound to treat as new names formed
by him, but only as varied orthographies of those which he has altered.
Very many of the generio denominations used by SIMON were 31-
ready appropriated to other animals before they were used as names for
γ spiders 2). They must accordingly be rejected and, where necessary, be
replaced by others, either by already existing synonyms or by new formed

1) More reasonable grounds for altering the orthography of certain names in
the classification of spiders are not wanting, and SIMON would no doubt have won the
approbation of many, had 110 written Oltiracanthz'zcm instead of Cheirczcanthz'um, Hy-
ptiotes for L'22ti0te3‚ Philoeca for Philoica. etc. Several of the names which SIMoN
himself desires to introduce into the science, and in the formation of which he has
used Greek words, which 110 has specified, stand in sore need of such correction.
Thus it seems to us tolerably evident that the name formed by the eombination of
μελία and κέρας should not be Melicertus, but perhaps Melicerus, or rather Melio-
ceros,· of ἄρ’ῥην and κέρας 0110 would form not Arrecerus, but 0. g. Arrhenoceros; of
νέω and σχοῖνος 0110 111357 form Neoselzoena, but not Neoscona,· of τρι and (ἵκανθα“
Triaccmiha, not Tricantha; of σύν and αἱμα Synoema, not Synema; of κιρῥός (light
yellow) and φέρω Oirrhophora, not C'z'rrofera, 010. In a couple of the names formed
by SIMON, the letters ζ and ξ 113νο 110011 eonfounded: he writes Pezionyoe instead of
Pemz’onym (from πῆξις and ὄνυξ), szptila instead of Oxyptz'la (from ὀξύς and πτίλον);
in two others he has confounded v and ου, viz. in Nuctobz'a (νυκτόβιος) and Nuctenea
(νύξ, νέω), which should be written Nyctobz'a and Nyctinea. Fortunately most of the
names formed by SIMON will probably be found supererogatory.
