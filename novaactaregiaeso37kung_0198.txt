38 T. Trionem,

To point out and correct the numerous erroneous or contradictory
statements we have met with in SIMON's work, excepting where they con-
cern the synonymies of the European spider-fauna, would be foreign to the
problem we are endeavouring to solve. It would moreover be an unneces-
sary and thankless task, for these errors are generally of such a character
that they are readily seen by any one tolerably versed in arachnology. —
SIMON appears to have no idea⁷ that' a name, once imposed, ought to be
respected, and not arbitrarily changed for another. He rechristens LA-
TREILLE'S Oteniza (= Nemesz'a SAV. et AUD.) zllyyalodouzta‚ merely because he
imagines himself to have discovered, that the former apellation ”est restee
inconnue.'⁷ The name Aulonz‘a C. KOOH he rejects without assigning any
reason at all, and gives to that genus the new name Lycosimz. Itis there· ¹
fore evident that many changes must be made in his nomenclature: the
name Actinopus PERTY has right of priority before Splzodros WALOK., ¹)
Which is adopted by SIMON7 Palpz'mmzus DUF. before (Platyscelum SAV. et
AUD.‚ and) Chersis WVALCK.⁷ Suu„ etc. Several corrections connected with
this we shall have occasion to make in the following pages.

VIEW oF THE GENERA oF EUROPEAN SPIDERS.

It is customary to begin the series of spiders with the Epeiroidae or
the Orbicelarz'ae. and in the following pages I have conformed to this custom,
because it appears to me that the proper-ties that distinguish the whole
Order of Spiders, are most strikingly seen in that family, and the Epeiroi-
dae may therefore be considered as including the very type itself of the Order.

- aalma DE HAAN [Crust] 18353 1 Latona SCHUM. [Moll] 18173 —— Pasithea LA-
MOUROUX [Polypi] 18123 — Τνῐσῑανία WAen. [Aves] 1838} — The name Cyplzayoyus
has been given to a genus among the curculiones [Coleopt.] long before 1862, accord-
ing to GERSTXCKER (Bericht ub. die wissensch. Leistungen im Gebiete d. Eutomolo-
gie wahr⁴ d. Jahres 1862, p. 560».

1) Sphodros was, it is true⁷ already in 1833 mentioned hy WALCKENAER in his
Mem. s. une nouv. classif. d. Arane'ides, but all that is there communicated about
that genus, is, that it has ’'les yeux ecartes” like Missulena (Erz'odon), and that
it is ''intermediare entre les Missulenes et les Mygales'', which assuredly cannot be
considered as a characterization of the genus. — (Splzodrus CLAnw. [Coleopffl 1806).
