Ι begin then with that family. not because Ι consider it to stand higher
than others, but for the sanie reason, for which, when systematically 110111-
ing, for instance, the Class of Fishes, 0110 usually goes 0111 from the
Teleostei 01· Bony 1151105, and not from the undoubtedly far highcr organized
Selaelzioe [and Dipnoi} I am far from persuaded that the family Epeiroidae
really includes the highest forms within the Order Aranere. If wc had only
to take account of the development of the instz‘ncts, we might7 in eonsi-
deration 01 1110 more artistic- construction 01 1110 webs of the Epeiroidae„
place that gronp above the other families 011110 Οι·1101·; but then again, if
we consider, as we reasonably ought 10 110, 111010 1110 harmonicus develop-
ment 011110 body's various parts, the superior development of the organs
01 501150, and suchlike, we 50011 500 that the Epehoidae, with their weak
cephalothorax 11011 heavy abdomen7 their slow and clumsy metiens, their
comparatively small eyes, 010, 1110 5111111155οᾶ by more than 0110 1111110
other families‚ usually looked upon as lower. Generally speaking, the
opinion that spiders which build a web, 1110 higher animals than those
which hunt 111011· prey‚ seems 10 110 111110111111011. Tho'se which 1110 most
peijf'ecz‘lgs orgycmz'wd ought 10 have the higl'ier rank assigned 1110111, and it
appears to me difficult 10 show, that in that respect the wectvers in any
way take precedenee of the lzwzters. The family leeraplwsoidoe 01· λίῃῃαῖίῑῖσε,
which surpass all other spider-families in nzczynz’z‘zccle, form through Li-
plzz'stius desultor 8011Ιὸ11111, which is destitute 01 5111011015 and has the back
011110 abdomen covered with jointcd horn-shields⁷ a connexion with the
Phrynoidoe and δσοηήονῑε, which I believe must be considered as more
highly organized 1101101115 than spiders 1). Τ110 Lycosoz'dce, and in a still

1) I do not however consider the remarkable agreement between Lipltisnius and
Phrynns 115 proving that that genus has any 0011101· qfsinity (depending on a closer
propinquity of deseent) to Plzrgsnus than other spiders have, but Ι only consider
it as an example of 1110 mzalogygs that cau exist between groups of animals 00111111-
mately related. In the case 01 spiders this 15 not a solitary example. Anetes ειε-
Zetrum MENGE (Verz. d. Danziger 811100011, p. 71), which is said 10 stand. in near
relation to Arcys among the leorizisoz'clcc2, is without 5111110015, like Lipltistins. The
relationship which VINSON believes to exist between 1110 Ε11011·01(1 genus Aradium-a
Vms. (Aran. d. 1105 de la Reunion ete„ p. 289) —- in which genus the abdomen is
drawn out into a kind of 11111- and the Scorpions⁷ depende upon a similar, only still
weaker analogy. MAG LEAY mentions (On some new forms 01Α1·1101111., p. 5) ”a
singularly flat and minute, hard-shelled, six—eyed spider with a sessile abdomen⁷⁷‚
which is met with in Cuba, and which he considers 115 forming the connecting link
between spiders and Aemi. Here perhaps we have an instance of true zrfsz'm'ty
between spiders and a lower group: indeed the Order of spiders is undoubtedly no
