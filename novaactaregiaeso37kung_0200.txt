highcr degree the Attoz’doe‚ distinguish themselves by their well proportion-
ed forms, their powerfully developed cephalothorax, by the quickness and
force of their movements, highly developed organs of sight, and the Atto-
z‘doe also by an expression of intelligence, which cannot escape even the
most casual observer, and which, among other lower invertebrate animals,
is only to be found in that Order of Insects which comprises undeniably
the most highly developed animals of this Class, the Hymenoptera. As
regards the other reasons that have been adduced in support of the as-
sumption of the preeminence of the Epeiroidae before all other spiders‚
such as the numerousness and beauty of the species⁷ the small number of
transition-forms‚ etc.‚ they hold equally true of the Attoz'clae‚ which form a
unit quite as close, compact and rich in species as the Epeiroidae3 in the
brilliancy and variety of their colours they surpass both these and the
other families of spiders, and may even be compared with the most showy
faniilies of Coleoptera⁷ so distinguished for beauty and brilliancy of colour.

If it is difficult to agree on, which group of spiders is to bc consi-
dered as the Ιιίρῖιεπ, it is on the contrary easy enough to determine which
of the sub-orders received by us occupies the lowest rank. We without
hesitation assign that place to the lichit-alarice, among which, it is true,
clear and defined transition-forms to lower groups of animals are as little
to be met with as in any of the other sub-orders, but which nevertheless
show themselves in many respects to stand in a lower stage than the other
great subdivisions of the Order. The gradual reduction of the organs of
vision is already one evidence of this: most of the spiders, that have only
six eyes belong to this sub-order, and it is only within its compass that
species have been found having only two eyes (Nom), or even totally

mere connecting link between two other orders of Arachnoidea, but appears to have
been developed side by side with the so-called Artlzroyastra (Solifzzyoe SUND.) from
an inferior group, probably the Opiliones. In the families of the Scytodoidae and
Filistacoidoe are several features that may be considered to indicate relationship with
the last-named order, as for ex. the process at the extremity of the mandible, which
in conjunction with its claw almost forms a two-fingered forceps3 the extraordinarily
long legs of Polcus, the tarsus divided into three parts, etc.—— HAECKEL (Gene—
relle Morphologie d. Organismen, II, p. XCVII) believes that spiders were developed
from the Galeodoidoe, independently of the other divergent branches which, accord-
ing to his view, go out from the Galeodoidce, viz. scorpiones (including Phrynm) and
Opiliones; he considers the Saltiqradoe as the spiders, which still stand in the near-
est relation to the Galeocloidae, probably on account of the apparent segmentation
of the cephalothorax in the genus lllyrmeoimn. I can however in no wisc accede to
this opinion.
