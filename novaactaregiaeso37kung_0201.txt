C'itzyraslae, Orbitelarioe ete, the sub-order Tabitelarzsse is extremely polymor-
plzons, and forms only a looscly connected combination of very heteroge-
neous elements: it must be dividcd into many families and a great number
os genera, and but few of these last seem to contain more than a very
limited number of species. Transition-forms 10 almost all the 0111018111)-
orders are also to be found among the Tuln'telarioe‚ which form as it were
the chaos, t'rom which the other more sharply defined and clearer types
have been gradually developed. The forms are frequently coarse, ugly
and clumsy, the 0010111· dark and dusky3 even their generally concealed and
nocturnal habits indicate the lower rank of these animals. Among the dif-
ferent families, into which this sub-order is dividcd, the first place must
certainly be assigned 10 1116 Ayalmoidoe; the remaining familics would ap-
pear 10 be in about the same stage of development, though probably the
Filistatoidae are the lowest. With them may be Joined, as occupying an
equally low position, the family Scytodoz'dae in the sub—order Retitelarice.
XVhether we endeavour to arrange the families and genera of spiders
in a continuous series, from that group which is looked upon as the most
perfect, down to the lowest, 01· vice versa, or whether we arrange them
after any other principle, we are 80011 met by the same difficulties which
present themselves, wheuever we endeavour to arrange in such a manner
any class or order whatever of the productions of nature. We are soon obli-
ged to abandon the hope of making the arrangement fully 11010ναῖ, 1. e.
such as to give a clear view of the more near or distant relationships of the
various groups, and their thence following mutual similarities and dissimi-
larities, and in the choice of the various combinations that offer themselves,
we have, as WALCKENAER (Tabl. d. Aran, p.X11) happily cxpressed himself,
often enough only ”le choix des inconvenients'⁷. The arrangement of the
series itself is accordingly often enough tolerably unimportant, if 0116 only
take care in some other way to account for the natural relations which the
various groups have to each 011161. Α8 regards the larger groups of spiders,
the sub-orders and the families, the reasons for the order of arrangement
we have chosen will, we hope, easily be seen if 0116 casts one’s eye on

TELLKAMP (Beschr. einig. neuen in d. Mammuth-Hohle aufgef. Glicderth, p. 318, Taf.
VIII, fig. 13—17) probably belongs to this family, and not 10 1116 Ταννίτεῖανίεε as
TELLKAMP supposes: Compare his description and figure of the animal’s mandibles
(''Kieferklauen einyeschlayen'⁷) and maxillae.
