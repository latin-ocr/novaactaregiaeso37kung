the aeeompanying diagrain, which gives a view of the connexion founded
on real affinity which the families of the spiders adopted by ns, aecor-
ding to our opinion, have with eaeh other 1). That connexion is more ea-
sily shown in a plane than in a series, but of course even that method of
representation still leaves much ‘to be desired. Thus e. g. the line (13)
that marks the Thomisoz'doe ought to be supposed drawn in another plane,
so that the distance between the leeraphosoidoe (10) and ‘the Lycosoz'doe (14)
may not be greater than between the first of these and the Thomz'soicloe (13).

We first divide the order of spiders (ARANEAE) into 7 snb-orders.-
Ι. Θνόἱΐθῖανίω, ΙΙ, Ιίεΐῖτεῖανίῑε, ΠΙ. Τηόἰΐθίανίω, IV. Τσννὶίεῖτινῖεε, V. Cili-
9radw, VI. Laterz‘ffladce, and VH. .5(tltz]«71¹atl1e‚ corresponding to the old,
almost similarly named Latreillian families (Recitelarz‘ae NOB. = Jnoeqnitelae
LATR.) 2). These subdivisionis moreover fall asunder into the 22 families
inserted 111 the figure. If we begin with the TubiteZm-z'ae as the lowest sub-
(11·(101-7 we might also consider the others as radiating from it 111 three prin-
eipal branehes. whereof 0110 is eomposed of the [emtam-ise and Orbitelczriae,
another of the Territemriae, the third of the L‹1te1⁶22cs1=acz<e‚ Oitiqmdce aud

haps then be most accurately eonjoined 111 the following manner:

of the similarity of organie beings —is the hond, hidden as it is by various degrees
