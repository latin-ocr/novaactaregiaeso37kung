Coneerning the ‹nrotic families accepted by us a few words appear ne-
cessary. The family illyr}mecz'oz'dw stands almost hals-way between the Attoz'dw
and the Drassoidoe, and, though forming a continens series with them⁷ cannot
well be aggregated to eitlleix—The wonderful genus Otiothops MAG LEAY¹)‚
which differs from all other known spiders in the form of the first pair of
legs, which are palpiform‚ short and thick, without elaws, and composcd
of only 6 joints, certainly appears to stand nearest to Palpz‘manus among
the E›·esoidoe. but cannot easily be united either with that or any other as yet
formed family, on which account we have been obliged to set up a new
family especially for it, the Otioz‘lzopoz'doe. — thether the Dfnopoidae really
ought to occupy the place Ι have allotted to them⁷ is uncertain: L. KOCH2')
unites them with the Eremloe, to which they appear to ine to approach
nearest: DOLESOHALL ³) however says of a speeies described by him, Dinopz's
Kollari from Amboina, that ‘'it builds a very long irregular weh between
trees, in the middle of which web it sits, with its frontmost pair of
legs stretched out.'‘ DOLESCHALL plac-es Dinopis between Dolomedes and
O.vgs0pes‚· even MAG LEAY, who was the first to make known this genus,
reckons it to the ζ’ἰῖῑζᾳναῑῖαε. —As regards the Catadysoz'doe, Ι have thought
it necessary to form that new family for the North American Catadysas
[Κηϊα-1193113] pumilus HENTZ 4), which, by having the palpi inserted near the
extremity of the maxillae, and by the longitudinal direction of the mandi-
bular claw, is related to the typical leeraphosoz'doe, but in other respects
seems to approach very near to the Lgscosoidae: like them it is said to have
only two tracheal ('’pulmonary”) saes— The family Liplzistioz'doe has been

Bipulmona‘z'res: DCFOUR (Tetralmemnones and Dipneumones: LATR.]‚ is now, I think,
pretty generally abandoned.

ὠθέει) or offecto), run against, push, and ὤψ, eye, with reference to the circumstance7
that the two posterior intel-mediate eyes, which are of different size, stand so close
together, that the larg-cr seems to push the smaller out of the way. The name in
this ease ought to be quite otherwise written — one might at least alter it to Otlzz'o-
tops. But, as some may perhaps prefer to derive the word from ω’ῑίον, a little ear,
and θώψ, flatterer, however impossible that etymology may appear to me, I have
not considered niyself at liberty to alter the usually received way of writing the
word. In AGAssiz' Nomencl. Zool. it is derived from ὠτίον, auris and ὥψ facies!
