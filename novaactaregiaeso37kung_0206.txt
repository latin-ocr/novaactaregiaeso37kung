44 TX'PHORELL,

formed for thc remarkable genus Lilrahz‘stius SCHIoD'rE1) —from the Island of
Pinang--wliich, as we have already observed, differs from all other known
spiders in having the back of the abdomen covered with a row of horny
plates jointed into one another, and which is destitute of spinncrs, but in
other respects is similar to the Theo-aphosoidoe. — Lasssy, the family Omanoz'dae
is identical with the OEcobz'z'dice BLACKW. 2), a family, which BLACKWALL
has formed for a six-eyed spider with calamistrum and infra-mammillary
organ and two claws on the tarsi, and which he has described under the
name of OEcobius navus,- this spider does not however belong to the genus
OEcobz'ns LUCAS (as will be shown under that genus), and we have therefore
changed its name into Qucum, and that of the family into ommim.—
For the new families formed by us, that have rcpresentatives in the fauna
of Europe7 wc shall have occasion fully to account in the following pages.
