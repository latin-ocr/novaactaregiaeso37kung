Sym: Yide inl'rn sub Fam. Epeiroirlffl.

The European spiders belonging to this sub-order, which comprises
only one family, the Epeiroidw, are, as is known, most easily distinguished
from their nearest relations, the Retz‘telcm'oe, by a very low, not transversally
impressed forehead, where the distance between the margin of the clypeus
and the intermediate of the anterior eyes is less, 01· at any rate not greater,
than that between the anterior and posterior intermediate eyes (except in
the case of some males with a strongly projecting forehead); in the Ratira-
Zariae on the contrary (with the exception of Tapz'nopa) the former distance
is yreaz‘er than the latter. They all have three strong, genuine claws on
the tarsi, of which the two superior are pectinated, and the. inferior armed
with two close and (except in the case ot lssIyptz'otes) blunt coinb-teeth3 in
Uloborus and Qsrcolffwm conica alone Ι have observed on that claw only one
well developed tooth. Moreover the extremity of the tarsus is always previded
with two or more accessory (or auxiliary) claws. The palpus-claw in the
female is always well developed, pectinated or serrated. The first pair of
legs is longer than the others, except in Cerealia (Cerceis MENGE). The
spinners are short, the superior and inferior about equal in length.

In this family we include all the spiders already reckoned as be-
longing to it by LATREILLE, who called the family Orbiteloe‚ and by SUN-
DEVALL, who introduced the appellation Epeirides‚ accordingly all those
that spin regular, so-called ’'gyeometrz'caff webs. Amongst C. KOCH’S spider-
families, besides his Epeirz‘des‚ the Mammida, including the genera Poltys
and Makras (Ηῃνῑὶοῴεεχ XVALCK.), belong to this family. That Poltys O. KOCH
