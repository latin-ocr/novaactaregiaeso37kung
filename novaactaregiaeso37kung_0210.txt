Kocu or J'Iyptiotes‚ Ῑ have 111 6 previous paper ²¹) endeavoured to show its
near relationship to Uloborus LA'rR. and consequently its connexion with
the Epeiroidae, whereof more farthcr on under the Gen. fflsptiotes. -
WESTRING gives to 11116 family the same 11111116 11161 we have assigned to
11; BLACRWALL on 1116 contrary separates Uloborus (Veleda BLACKW.) and
Hjesptiotes from the Epeiroidae and includes them among his Cimflonz'dae, on
which step we shall presently have occasion to express our opinion (when
treating the sub-family Ulohorivoe) — SIMON'S arrangement 01 11116 family,
which he calls ''Epe‘z'J-z'formes'' 3), appears to 1116 1101 particularly happy.
He divides it into four '⁷tribus’': ·1:o ”Nnccobz'enffl or ''lee'rz'dio-Epesires’⁷ (for
the genus Ngsctobz'a Sin. Ξ Meta C. Kocn -Ι- Ζίῖία ID), 2ιο '‘Patr-‘rayna-

XVALCIOENAER'S ’'Linyphies epeirides'⁷); 320 ''Epe'z’rz'ens'⁷ (including Siuya,
Epeira, IVeplrila, Gasteracam‘lza, Aemwma, Araclmzcra and Doloplzones), and.

according to VINSON, 4) who assigns them a place among the Livzyphiw,
parasitically in the '⁷toiles’⁷ 01 certain Epeiroidae, in which they weave
”leurs petits reseaux.'' VINSON does not say 11161 111666 ’'iescam'' have a
form different from those of other Linyphiae‚ which I think 116 would not
have omitted to do if such had been the 6666, and it is therefore not prob-
able that the webs 01 111666 spiders are like those 01 1116 Epeiroidae, or
that Aayyrocles belongs to that family. — That there is 110 11661· connexion
between Eresus and 1116 Epeiroidae, it 16 probably unnecessary 10 prove. —
Uloborus and Zosis (= Orithyia BLACKW.) undoubtedly deserve in combina-
tion with Hyptiotes to be classed 66 6 separate ⁷⁷t1·ibus'' or sub-family on

Tetrctgynatha on the contrary 16 closely related to Mem, and that genus,
as also Zz'c‘la, is 60 intimately connected with Epez'ra and Singa, that these
5 genera can hardly be distributcd among different sub—families. — MENGE,
whose ’'tribus’' orbicolae corresponds to our Epeiroidae, divides G) the spiders
of this tribus described by him, (all of which belong to the sub-family
