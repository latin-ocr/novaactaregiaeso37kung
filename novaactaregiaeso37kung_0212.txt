Whether Dolophones notacantlzas (QUOY et GAIM.) l) really belong to the
Ovvbitelarz'oe. and Epeiroidce‚ as SIMON thinks,2) appears to me tolerably doubtful.
’ The New-Holland genus Celoenia THOR.,³) distinguished by its high
clypeus and its long slcndcr anterior pairs of legs developed into a sort of pe-
des ammorii, the two upper tarsal claws of which are of very different size,
ought certainly to form a separate sub-family (perhaps a particular family). This
genus has 3 claws upon the tarsi, which is said not to be the case with the, as
it seems, else so nearly related genus Tklaosoma CAMBR., the species of
which, according to CAMBRIDGE,4) have only two tarsal claws, and make
no web⁷ but live ”beneath folded leaves.’' OAMBRIDGE assigns Thlaosoma
to the Thoonem-loe, to which family Celoem'a at any rate cannot be
aggregatcd.

Wnrffl has 5) under the name of Linyphz'a (Leucauye) cnyyrobapta
described a spidcr taken by DARWJN in Brazil, which probably belongs to the
Epeiroz'doe; at least there is reason to suppose SO, in consequence of the
following notice of the remarkable method pursued by this species in the
construction of its web, which WHITE communicates from DAawln's MSS.
''Web very regular, nearly horizontal, with concentric circles: bcneath, but
sometimes above, the concentric web, there is an irregular or thin tissue
of network; the animal rests in the centre, on the inferior surface.'’
