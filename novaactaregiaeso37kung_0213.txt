ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 51

Sub-fam. Ι. EPEIRINAE.

Sym: 1841. Epeiridae Bmcnw„ The differ. iu the nmnb. of eyes etc„ p 668.
1866. Epeiridae MENGE 4.- Tetragnathidae 1D., Prenss. Spinn.‚ I, p. 40, 90.

This sub-family includes all the gyenuz'ne Europcan Epeiroids, i. e. those
that are destitute of infra-mamillary organ and calamistrum. The Epeirinae
belonging to the fauna of Europe may, we think, be united under the genera
Avyiope, Epeira, C'yrtoplzora, Simyra, Cercidz'a, Zilla, Meta and T etraynafflza,
all which, with the exception of the last, constitute porticus of the old
WValckenaerian genus Epeira.

Type: Aiyz'ope lobata (PALLAS).

We take this genus, which has been separated from WALCKENAER'S
Epeira by SAVIGNY and Amoocm, in its original compass, which indeed seems
to be the same as that assigned to it by SUNDEVALLl) and KEYSERLING 2),
whereas some of the species attributed by O. KOCH and SIMON to the genus
Aryiope, e. g. A. tridentatus and yonyyaster‚ hardly seem rightly to belong
to it. SAV. and AUD. include (loc. eit. p. 329> Aranea Brimm'chii SOOP. (Ar.
fasc-iata OLIV.) in Arqiope, which is perfectly right. By O. KOOH it was
first erroneously assigned to Allircmda, and afterwards to Neplzz'la LEACH,
which is not a more fortunate disposition, as the characteristics that mark
this last genus (the anterior part of the cephalothorax elevated, broad3 ma-
xillae considerably longer than they are broad, etc.) by no means apply to
A. Bri'mm'chz'i3). The genus Nephila must7 for the present at least, be re-
moved from the list of the European genera of spiders. We suspect in fact
that Epeira ambayioscn WALOK. also is an Aryz'ope. SIMON indeed classes
it with the genus Neplzz'la (p. 276), and, following ἯῙΑΕΟΚΕΝΑΕΒ, gives
