52 T. THORELL,

''Espagne'' for its country, although on the page immediately following he says
Of Aoy. Bri'mnichii (Nephila fasciam SIM.) that it is ’'la seule espeoe Euro-
peenne⁷' of the genus Neplzz'la, and also omits to include E. ambagiosa in
his ”catalogue Sy1ionymique”; but it is referred by WALCKENAER himself ¹)
to the same (1⁰) Race of the genus Epeira's 4¹¹¹ family ('’les Decorees'')‚ to
which E. fasciam, ‹zm-elia, <etherea and the other species of Aryiope with
unlobated or unnotched abdomen belong.

With reference to the orthography of the name Aryz'ope, the follow-
ing remarks may be reasonably made ²). Both in the passage of the Descr.
de Z'Eyypte7 where that genus is described by AUDOUIN (T. XXII, p. 328 of
the 2⁸⁶¹ Edit.) and in the index to that volume (p. 466), its Latin name is
Avyz'ope, but in Freowh he calls it Arqyope (''Genre Aryyope, Aryiope'* just
as he writes ''Genre Te‘ye‘naz're‚ Teqeuarid', ''Genre Pholque, Pholcus⁷'
etc). This latter orthography has moreover since been used not only in
the French but also in the Latin names 3) of the species, and this has caused
several subsequcnt authors to write Aryyope instead of Aryiope. As however
AUDOUIN first, and in elzarczcterizz'ny the gyenvcs, wrote Αφῃίορε, that orthography
must be preserved, especially as it is that which is etymologically right
(see the derivation of the word above), and the unreasonable spelling Ar-
ιᾳμοιυε, which has been received by LUCAs‚ WALCKENAER and others - in-
cluding myself, 4) before I had the opportunity of consulting the Dese-r. de
Z'Eyypte — must be abandoned. LATREILLE first (loc. cit. in Syn.) changed
Aryz'ope into Arqyopes‚ in which he has been followed by SUNDEVALL‚ G.
ΚΟΟΗ, KEYSERLING and others, but shortly after wrote Aryyope (loc. cit).
-— The genus will, it is to be hoped, hereafter retain its original and

proper name: Aryiope SAV. et AUD.

3) The confounding of ἱ and 31 in names borrowed from the Greek is not
very rare among French writers. SIMON for ex. has in his Hist. Nat. des A1·aignees‚
p. 433 formed a genus that he calls Pachyptila‚ but p. 526, where he reckons up
the European species of that genus, he calls it Paelzyptgsla.
