Among· modern authors only LUCAS‚ BLACKWALL, VINSON and a few
others have preserved WALCKENAER'S genus Epeira (=Aranea LA'rR.1804)
undivided. Separate groups of species have from 111116 10 time been taken
from it, and formed into particular genera, aud although several of these
(especially those formed by O. KOCH) are very imperfectly characterized,
they have yet, though often with modified 11111115, been more or less gene-
rally accepted. The greater part of the species included by KOCH in his genera
Miranda and Area we refer to Epeira strictly so called: his Aleta, Zilla
and Sinya (with the limits assigned to the two first by WESTRING and to
the last by MENGE and ourselves) may on the other hand be suffered to
retain their place as independent genera. The determination of Epeira
sensu strictiori given by us in Rec. crit. (p. 106) has been adopted by
WESTRING (loc. cit.); we now however think that E. conica were better se-
parated froin Epez'ra and referred to a separate genus, Cyrtophora (Sin).
SIMON'S view of the genus Epeira agrees with that of WESTRING, except
that, in conformity with KOCH‚ he reckons E. conica to δέημα. Η6 1110160-
” ver divides Epeira into three sub-genera, miranda, Area and Epeira‚ and
this last sub-genus 116 farther divides into six '’groups'’7 Nyctinea [Νῖιεῐεηεα]9
Eriophora, Neosclzoena [Neoscona]‚ Neopora, Epeira and Cyrtoplzora, most
of which appear to be ¹even more unnecessary and still worse defined than

1) In AGAsslz' Nomencl. Zool. it is derived from ”ἐπείρομαι, examin01·”‚ a deriva-
tion which appears to me destitute of all grounds. According to Simon, Epeira comes
from ”ἐπείρω, faire un tissu'⁷‚ which verb I have not been able 10 1111(1 111 any Greek
Lexieon to which I have access. —- May not the name perhaps be formed of ἐπί, οη,
and εἶρος, wool (with reference to the circumstance of the female's being usually
found, after laying her eggs, sitting beside or upon the wool-like cocoon)‘? — As
however all this is but conjecture, I have not ventured, like EmensoN and SCHI'ODTE,
to change the received orthography Epeira into Epira.
