the sub-genera proposed by KOCH. — Of KOOH⁷S above named new genera
KEYSERLING adopts only llIeta ¹).

MENGE 2), 111 dividing WALCKENAER⁷S genus Epeira‚ has adopted
KOCH⁷S Sinya, Zdla, quia, Mz'randa and Meta, 66 6160 Epeira, but not
Alea, and has moreover formed two new genera, Qzsclosa (for E. conica)
and Cerceis (for Simyra prominens XVESTR.) But 66 116, 111 marking the 6116-
racteristics of these genera, fixes his attention almost exclusively on diffe-
rences in the organs of generation, differenees which do not seem to me
sufficient to distinguish genera, I have not for the present considered
it advisable to adopt his division entirely unaltered, more especially as, in
many of the 61166166, only one sex is known, and MENGE has therefore in
some cases been uncertain whether the 61166166 really belong to the genus
to which he has aggregated them or not. To Miranda he assigns, besides
certain species referred to it by O. KOCH, Ep. acalyplza WALCK.; whereas,
according to the characteristics given by MENGE, the following for example
do not belong to his Illiranda: Epeira armida SAV. and AUD. and M. cero-
pegyz'a O. KOCH (which is not identical with E. ceropefyz'a WALGK., as we shall
hereafter, when we come to examine XVESTRING'S E. ceropegyia, show), al-
though they are very nearly related to Epeira ceropeyz'a WALCK. and E.
adianta 1D., which MENGE assigns to Miranda. — The greatest part of the
species, that compose KOCH⁷s Area, are referred by MENGE, 66 6166 by us,
to Epeira. —- Zgsgyz'a (Z. (111τὶ66) differs only by modifications of the organs of
copulation fron] Zilla‚ which genus in MENGE⁷S work embraces only Zilia
montana WESTR. (non Koon), described by MENGE under the name of Z.
calophylla. The true Z. calophylla (WALCK.) O. KOCH does not, according
to the characteristics given by MENGE, belong either to quz'a or Zz'ZZa. —
Simyra promz'nenS, which 1166 1116 4⁸¹¹ pair of legs longer than the others,
well deserves to be received 66 1116 type of a new genus, Cercidz'a NOB.
(z Cerceis MENGE). -— Ep. comba (and probably also Ar. citricola FORSK.‚ Ep.
oculata WALCK. and some others) ought to be united with Ep. opzmtz'ae ΒΗΚ,
which hythe greater distance between the lateral eyes, and by the peculial·
form of its abdomen, seems to form the type of a separate genus, Cyrtophora
Suu. ad part.

OHLERT 3) has latterly endeavoured more aecurately to determine and
fix the genera reckoned by O. KooH to the Epeiroidae, which are repre-
sented in the Prussian fauna. He first divides them into three groups. In
the first group (including the genera Epeira, Siuya, Illiranda and Atea)
