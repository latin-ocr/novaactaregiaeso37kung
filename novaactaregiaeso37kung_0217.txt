On EUROPEAN spumas. 55

the {lm pair of legs is more than half as long as thc first pair3 iu the se-
cond group (Zynqz'a and Zilla) the length of the ΒΜ pair is less than half
that ot' the 1⁵¹5 and lastly in 1110 third group (illotas) the length of the 3⁸¹
pair is equal to half that of thc first. The first group is also distinguished
from the second and third by the form of the 4¹¹¹ joint of thc inale's palpi,
which is short, broad and bowl-formed, not, as 111 1110 case of thc others,
cylindrical and of greater length than 111-01111111 — a characteristic accordingly,
that holds good only for 0110 sex. The distinctions derived from the rela-
tive length 01 1110 1⁵* and 3¹⁴¹ pairs of legs do not however hold even for the
few species that OHLERT has treated: 111 1115 Zz'lla acalyplza (at least Q) for ex.
the 3¹⁶¹ pair of legs is 1101 at all shorter but 011 1110 contrary considerably
longer than half the 1³¹, and that species ought therefore not to have been
referred to Zz'lla but to Epeira <to which genus I have aggregated it) or
δέημα. Moreover this relation is sometimes different in the different sexes
of the same speeies.1> —— Within the first group, Epeira and Simyra on the
one hand are distinguished from Mimmla and Atea on the other by the 4
intermediary eyes 01 1110 first named genera forming a mmmmm, of which
the posterior side is shorter than the anterior, and being all of about the
same 51Ζο7 whereas in the latter they form a rectoenyle, and the hindermost
of them are sensibly larger than the anterior ones. Of how little conse-
quence however these differences are, will doubtless be immediately seen
by anybody who has examined a larger number of not only European
Epeiroidae. If suchlike trifling differences in the position and 51Ζο 01 1110
eyes are to be considered as decisive 111 1110 formation, within this family,

1) In a large full-grown female of Meta Menardz· (LATR.)‚ I find the length of
the 1δι and ΒΜ pairs of legs, reckoned from the edge of the cephalothorax, respec-
tively 3272 and 19 72, or, if the 0οΧἱο be taken into account, 34 and 21 millimeters3
accordingly the gra pair of legs more than half as long as the ist. This is also
certainly the case in the male M. Menardi: in the only full-grown specimen Ι have
of this spider, the tarsi of the 1st pair are wanting, but if these be considered as
only half the length of the metatarsi, the ΒΜ pair in this specimen will still be longer
than half the first. — In a moderate-sized Ο71 01 Meta stIerianoe (Scor.) I have indeed
found the 15ι pair of legs just double the length of the third, when the coxae are
included, but in ῼ 1110 case is otherwise: in a small, but fullgrown female specimen
I found the first pair of legs 14¹⁰¹¹¹< and the ΒΜ pair 8 sssum, reckoned from the edge
of the cephalothorax3 reckoned from the bases 011110 coxae these pairs were respec-
tively 15¹⁰m· and 9¹s2mm· long. — In 0⁷¹ of ZiZZa reticulata C. KOCH 01· Meta 869171οη-
tata (CLEROK) the first pair is more than double, nearly 3 times, as long as the
3³⁶, but in the female scarcely double: if the coxae are included, the ΒΜ pair is at
least sometimes longer than half the first.
