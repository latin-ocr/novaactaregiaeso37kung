of generic groups, the genera will be in the highest degree artificial‚ and
species in all other respects very nearly related will be torn from each other
and referred to different genera: e. g. E. anyulata will be separated from
E. bicornis, which must be an Atea OHL., E. sclopetarz'a from E. sollers,
which would also, according to this system, belong to the genus Atat,- Sinya
pyymoea (S. IIerz'z' WESTR.) and S. albo-vittata fron] S. hamata, and so forth.
—— Atea ¹) according to OHLERT is distinguished from lustranda, by the lateral
eyes being in the last named genus more than double, whereas in Acea
they are less than double so far removed from the intermediary eyes, as
these are from each other, and the anterior series being in Asea straight and
in Alliranda slightly curved backwards. (According to O. KOCH the anterior
intermediary eyes in Atea arc fai-ther apart than the posterior, whereas
according to OHLERT these four eyes are placed rectangularly, —- and yet
both these authors refer the same species, Ep. ayaleoza WALCK., to the
genus Area.) -— OHLERT distinguishes Sinya from Epeira by the side-
eyes being in δέημα at the same distance, and in Epeim at double the di-
stance from the intermediary eyes, which the anterior intermediasy eyes are
from each other. If there were no transitions (as however there are both to
Area and Miranda), this would be a very good characteristic3 and the
genus Sinya is perhaps the only one of KOOH⁷S new genera here mentioned,
which can in the present state of the science be retained, not so much
however on account of anything characteristic in the position of the eyes, as
for the animal's general form and appearance, somewhat resembling that of
certain Theridioidae. (Conf. WESTRING, Aran. Suec, p. 56). —— In addition
to the above-mentioned really trifling and moreover not even constant diffe-
rence in the proportion of the length of the 1⁵t and 3¹1¹ pairs of legs, which,
according to OHLERT, exists between Zyyia and Zilla, 011 the one side and
illem 011 the other, the two first of these genera are stated to have their
eyes reetanyularly placed, and the lateral little more distant from the
intermediary eyes than these latter fron] each other, whereas in the case
of Aleta the anterior intermediary eyes are somewlzat ozearer to each otker
than the posterior, and the side eyes at the same distance from the inter-
mediate as these latter from each other. All these are, as we have already
said, extremely weak and insignificant distinctions, which have not even
the merit of being reliable, for e. g. KOCH'S and OHLERT⁷S Zz'ZZa reticulata

1) Atea onelanoyaster O. KOCH (Dipaena melanoyaster NOB.) is not an Epei-
roid at all, but belongs to the family leerz'dz'oidoe. Vid. infra: Gen. Dipoena of
that family.
