The spiders which, in consequence of peculiarities in the form of 1116
abdomen, and usually also in the position of the eyes (conf. p. 49), we assemble
under this generic name, are chiefly exotic: the only species found in northern
Europe is Ar. conica PALLAS, which, sometimes referred 10 Epez'ra, sometimes
10 Sz'nya, sometimes elevated to the rank of a separate genus, appears to
us to stand in very close relation 10 Epeira opmztz'oe DUF. ¹), a spider which
we take as typical of 1116 genus Gyrtophorcc. and which seems 10 116 50 601151-
dered by SIMON (loc. 611). For C. emnem-MENGE has formed the genus
Cydam, which name, being younger, must 116 rejected in favour of that
given by SIMON. SIMON however aggregates to C'yrcoplwra several species,
which surely have little or no relationship with O. opuntiae: such are

Epeira mexicancc LUCAS‚ E. paradooea ID. — Which would 566111 to be a
Cyrtaraclme THOR. (Cyrtoyaster KEYSERL.) ——- and E. mitralz's Vmson,

belonging to the genus Caerostrz's THOR.‚ of 1116 other species of which
genus 0116, G. tuberculata (Vas), is included by SIMON in 1116 ’⁷g1·oupe⁷'
Erioplzora of the genus Epeira‚ and another, O. imperialis (WALCK.)‚ in
the sub-genus Eurysoma of 1116 genus Gasteracantha. 2) Further 011 in his
work (p. 494, 495) he assigns even the species of the ”groupe'⁷ of 1116 ge-
nus (and sub-genus) Ερεὶνα, for which he had first specially reserved that
name⁷ (E. anyulata, E. bicornis, eto), 10 Cyrtophm‘m Whereby this latter
group 15 certainly not made more natural.
