58 T. THORELL,

In C. opimam, as in most Epeiroidae, the inferior 131331 claw has two
comb-teeth in close juxtaposition, but in C. conica I have, as aforesaid,
not been able to discover more than one distinctly developed tooth (and
sometimes a very small point behind it) on that claw.

Type: Singya hamata (CLERCK).

This genus, formed by C. KOOH at the expense of WALCKENAER'S
Epeeva, is not ackowledged by BLACKWALL, but received by WESTmNe, who
however assigns it somewhat different limits from those given it by KOCH
(and 81111οΝ), paying more attention tc the form of the cephalothorax and
abdomen and the consequent peculiarities in the 3111111313 general appearance,
than to the position of the eyes, which but slightly deviates from that of
certain Epeirae, viz. those 111 which the 1316131 6γ63, like those of Sinfflz,
are little, if at all, more distant from the intermediary eyes⁷ than these
latter from each other. With MENGE‚ we assign to Simyra the same spe-
cies that are referred to it by WTESTRING⁷ exeepting S. prominens (and S. seu-
tzfera XVESTR.), for which MENGE has formed the genus Cerceis (Cerciclz‘a
NOB.). The limits between Epeira and Sinya are however by 110 means
sharply defined, and it 13 1101 without some doubts that I have here taken
up Sz‘nfsa as 311 independent genus separate from Epeircc. As its type
KOCH himself gives S. hamata (CLERCK). Concerning this genus see also
under Gen. Epeira (p. 53).
