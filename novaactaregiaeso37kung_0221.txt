T ype: Cercidz'a prominens (Wsss‘rn.)

This genus, set up by MENGE under the already engaged name of
Cerceis ¹) for WESTR1NG'S δέημα prominenS, differs in sundry important par-
ticulars from the other European Epeiroidae. The hard, almost leather-like
skin of the abdomen, and the unusual relative lengths of the legs (the 4²¹·
pair being longer than the first) are sufficient to justify the formation of
this new genus, but in addition to this there are, according to MENGE,
peculiarities in the structure of the organs of generation, and a small trans-
versal opening in front of the spinners, in which 4 fine tubes (supposed
by MENGE be air-tubes) terminate ²). The eocoon is like that of Ero but
without shaft. Conf. MENGE, loc. cit, p. 80, 81.

Type: Zilia aoy-notata (CLEROK.)

The genera Zilia and Aleta appear to us to have with good reason
been separated by O. KOCH from Epeira WVALOK.: they form in many re-
spects a transition to the family leerz'dz‘oz'dae. and are distinguished from
Epeira not only by Sinon, MENGE and OHLERT, but also by WESTRING3
BLACKWALL however still includes the species of this genus under Epeira.
SIMON has even formed of them a separate tribe of Epeiroidae, which, as we
have seen above, he calls ''mozonem'' or ''lee‘rz'dz‘o-Epe‘ires''3 they form however
