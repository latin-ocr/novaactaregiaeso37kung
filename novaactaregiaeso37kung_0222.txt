Zilla as sub-genera. (On this subJect 566 further under the article Meta).
As type for the genus Zz'lla, K00H1), it is true, gives Z. albimacuza (Ep.

cliodz'a WALCK.), but as we feel ourselves obliged to refer that species to
the genus Epeion, we have assumed as typical species Zyyz‘a caloplzylla

(WALCK.) 0. KOCH Ξ Ζ. „oc-notata (CLERCK), which appears to us best to
express the peculiarities of the genus, is the first 51166165 of the genus de-
scribed, and has since been by KOCH himself assigned to Zilla, 16-
gether with the very closely related Zilla montana O. KOCH. He accord-
ingly himself combined in 0116 1116 genera Zyyia and Zama, and entirely sup-
pressed the former name. In Zilia we also include a part of the unnatural

genus Euclzarz’a C. KOCH — which is formed chiefly of Thericlioidoe and is -

synonymous with Stecatoda (SUND.) Noss. — viz. E. affrica 0. KOCH. KOOH⁷S
Z. reticulata (Ar. seymentatus CLERCK.) we refer to Meta, his Z. albimaczcla and
Z. acalyplza to Epeira. The limits assigned by us to the genus are accord-
ingly 1116 561116 65 111656 proposed by XVESTRING (166. cit), which limitation
has the right of priority before that adopted by SIMON and OHLERT. In
SIMON, Zilla is a sub-genus under his Nyctobia, with about the same limits
as 111 KOCH, but includes also 51166165 ²), which according 16 1116 characteri-
stics given by SIMON himself and derived from the position of the interme-
diary eyes, ought 16 116 referred to his sub—genus Meta. — We have already
above in treating of Epeira (p. 55, 56) expressed our opinion that the characters
whereby OHLERT distinguishes Zilla and Zyyz'cz from Aleta are utterly in-
sufficient. MENGE and OHLERT readopt the genus Zyyia abandoned by KOCH:
MENGE separates it from Zilla in consequence of some difference in the organs
of generation in both sexes, OHLERT only in consequence of the greater
length, in the males, of the 4¹¹¹ joint of the palpi. How nearly related 16

before it was applied by KOCH to denote a genus of spiders, and ac-
cordingly cannot on any terms be retained 3). Also OHLERT assigns KocH'S
