Zilla reticulata (sefflnentata) and Zz'lla acalypha (Allz‘ramla acal-tspha MENGE)
to the genus Zz’lla: we, in unison with XVESTRING and MENGE‚ refer the
first mentioned (as has been already obscrvcd) to illata, whereas the other
appears to us to bc an Epeira. Z. reticulata in fact agrees in the form of
the maxillae, the position of thc eyes, and in its general appearance almost
exaetly with the species that typify Aleta (M. sslenardi (ΒΗΚ), M. Allerianoe
(SCOP.) C. KOCH); Z. acalyplm again in the relative lengths of the legs, and,
as far as we can judge from BLACKWALL’S and MENGE’S figures of the male,
also in the structure of the palpi of that sex, closely reselnbles the species
of Epez'ra XVESTRA both differ considerably from Zilia m-notata, affrica and
montana, which, while by their short maxillae they approach Epeira and
δέημα, by their weak cephalothorax and depressed, short and rounded ab-
domen exhibit a close analogy with the genus steatocla (SUND.), an ana-
logy, which led KoCH into the error of uniting within his genus Euclzarz'a
species of Steatoda and lilla, which belong to quite different families.
