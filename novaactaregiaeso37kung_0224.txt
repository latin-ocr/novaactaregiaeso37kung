since restricted by me (loc. 611), and subsequently by WESTRING and
MENGE‚ to those of KOCH⁷S Meta-speeies, which are really Epeiroz'doe, and
some very closely related species, e. g. Ar. seymentatus OLEROK (Ar. reti-
culata LINN.), which by KOCH and some others is erroneously referred to
Zilla. All these species have in their elonyated vzamz'lloe a common chara-
cteristic, which distinguishes them from the other European generic groups
separated from WALCKENAER⁷S Epeira (vid. sup.). BLACKWALL refers the
species of this genus to Epeira. SIMON has, as we have already seen,
combined Meta and Zz'ZZa to one genus, which 116 63116 Nyctobz'a 1), but
which however did not require a new name, as there were two older names
10 6110066 between. He divides it into two sub-genera, which preserve their
Kochian names, but of the species that compose Koen's Mem, he refers only
M. fusca KOCH (M. rllenardi) 10 illem (see more above under Ziela). OH-
LERT aggregates also M. Merianoe C. KoeH 10 Meta. The difference 111 1116
position of the eyes assumed by these writers as ground of distinction be-
tween the genera Allata and Zilla is too trifling to be acknowledged as of
‘any decisive weight in the characterization of genera3 we have accordingly,
as above mentioned, been obliged to transfer 0116 of their ZilZa-species (Z.
reticulata) to Meta. Also KEYSERLING, who at first united the genera Meta
and Τετναρηαῐήα, though he afterwards admitted the independence of the
former genus, finds its principal characteristic in the elongated maxillae,
but he assigns to it 1101 only 111066 Epeiroidae which C. KOOH referred to
Aleta, but also the ”lm famine, Coaclzcnatoe'', of WALCKENAER'S Τεύναφῑατῆαῗ).

1) Smox's reason for this name (from νύξ, night, and βιόω, live) probably was
that he considered VINson's ''Epeires nocturnes⁷⁷ as corresponding to KocH's Meta
and Zilla. At least he says (p. ⁶238) of the species of these genera, or Nyctobia

enough has not taken up a sinyle <me of Vmsorx’s ”Epeires nocturnes.'·' He classes
them all under his Epeira and Neplzz'la, which indeed appears⁴ to us right, but is
difficult to reconcile with his above quoted words. (Conf. VINSON‚ Aran. dela Reun„

3) Among the ancients τετράγναθον was the name of a venomous kind of arach-
noid animal, probably a Galeodes.
