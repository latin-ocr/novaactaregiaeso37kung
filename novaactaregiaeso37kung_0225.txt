To this genus, generally understood as comprising the compass as-
signed to it by LATREILLE and WALCKENAER, KEYSERLING2) also reckons
a spider, Enynatlza filg‘sbrmis SAV. and Anu, which by XVALCKENAER and
SIMON is referred to Uloborus, and in XVALCKENAER forms the ”3⁰¹⁰ Rae&
of that genus' ”1¹⁰ famille’' ³). It certainly belongs to the sub-family Epei-
rz'noe, and approaches much nearer to Tetmgynatha than to ll'lobows, hut ap—
pears to us, on account of its agreement with Uloborus in the relative length ⁴
of the legs and the position of the eyes, by its shorter maxillae, its abdo-
men of almost thread-like dimensione and drawn out in a point, eto, to
deserve to be considered as the type of a separate genus. We have else-
where 4) proposed to reserve to that genus the name of Euynatlm‚ under
which SAVIGNY and AUDomN united WALCKENAER'S Tetraynatha with that
writer⁷s Uloborns filzfhrmz‘s (loc. cit.) ⁵). - The spiders⁷ Which WVALCKENAER
(loc. eit, p. 219) classes under the genus Tetrayomtlza's 2⁰ss family, with the
name ”Coad2matae’'‚ KEYSERLING, as we have just seen, refers to filesa
KOCH. It seems to us that they ought rather to form a separate genus be-
twen Illam and Tetraynatlza. The ”3⁰¹⁹ Famille'⁷ of 'l'etrafflzatlza XVALCK.7 '’Le'-
zardg'formes'⁷, (loc. cit. p. 224) might also well be separated from Tetraynatlza
LATR.‚ and that genus be thus restricted to the compass, which it originally
had in LATREILLE and in WALCKENAER'S Tableau des Araoze‘ides. — The di-

ὃ) Neai· this genus Eufflzatlza (SAv. and ΑΕΒ.) stands DOLESCHALL'S Ariadne (Bijdr.
tot de Kenn. d. Arachn. v. d. Ind. Arch.⁷ p. 410) by the relative lengths of the legs
and the form of the abdomen (which is still more drawn out behind the spinners and
thread-like), but the position os the eyes is quite different. As the name Ariadne
had been already in mee—7 applied by SAV. and AUD. for another genus of spiders,
we have (p. 37) proposed to exchange the name Ariadne DOLESCH. for Aricmmes.
