stinctive marks, 011 which XVHITE formed the genus Dinoynatha, are too
trifling to warrant 1116 separation of the spiders thus characterized from
Tetragynatlza.

Sub-family Π. ULOBORINAE.

Under this denomination I include 111066 Epeiroidae, which are pro-
vided with iufra-mammillary ονῃαη (md calamistrum. The spiders of this
sub-family known to me all agree in at least 0116 111016 respect, viz. that
their Zeys are noc armed with spinas. Of the two European genera that belong
to this sub-family, Uloborus and Hyptiotes, the first named had, ever since
it was first so classed by LATREILLE, been considered as an Epeiroid, until
BLACKWALL discovered in U. Walelcemriz' (Veleda lineata BLAoKw.) the
agreement, which Uloborns, by 1116 presence of an infra-mammillary organ and
calamistrum, exhibits with Amaurobius (C. KOOH) z Cinzflo BLACKW. and
Dic-tyna SUND. :Erycztz's BLACKW. That agreement induced BLACKWALL to
refer Uloborns to the family C‘in't'flom'cloe, formed by him in 1841 101 1116 two
above named ξ(16116161), and placed between his Drassidoe and Affelenz'dae, so
that by BLACKWALL Uloborus is widely separated from the Epeiroidae. KEY—
SERLING2) assents to the opinion of BLACKWALL. —- We have already in the
preceding pages (p. 29) drawn attention to the unnatural character of the
family Ciniflonidae, in that it not only brings together forms so widely sepa-
rate as 6. g. Uloborus and Amanrobius, but even includes Eresus and Di-
wopis, for also these genera have an inf1·a-mannnillary organ and calamistrum.
As regards especially Uloborns, it appears to me that its agreement with
Epeim and Tetraynatha as well in the form of the cephalothorax and ab-
domen as in the structure of the parts of the mouth and the extremities
etc. must more than compensate 1116 differenceS, which are found, and which
wc have indicated above, that agreement is so complete as scarcely to re—
quire the additional evidence of 11116 genus' belonging to 1116 Orbitelariae
or Epeiroidae‚ which is furnished by 1116 circumstance, that its species all
spin regular, circular nets. 'We may also allow ourselves to call attention
to a commonly overlooked characteristic, which is found in Uloborns, as also
in all other Epeiroz'doe that Ι know of, and in a part only of the 11116νί111ίοί-
doe and Scytodoz'doe, but which is absent in the Tabitelarzke (even Amaurobz'-
