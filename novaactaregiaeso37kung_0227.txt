in the Territelarice that I have had the opportunity of examinhrg, namely‚
the presence of accessory claws, together with the (three) ordinary germine
claws, at the end of the tarsi 1). These aceessory claws are perhaps of
as much importanee for the animal's industry and for the determination of
its systematie position, as the infra-mammillary organ and calamistrum3 the
presence of these claws in Uloborvs may surely therefore be considered as
an additional reason for referring that genus to a family where they al-
ways occur, and separating it from forms, in which Ι have never observed
them. By considering Uloborus as the type of a separate sub-family of
the Epeiroidae, sufficient nctiee is certainly taken of the deviations of that
genus from the typz'cal Epeiroidae. — Besides the genera Uloborus, Hypnio-
tes and Zosis, it is probable that also Cyllopoclz'a HENTZ (Aran. of the Uni-
ted States, in Bost. Journ. of Nat. Hist.‚ V. p. 466), which is reported to
have only six eyes, belongs to the sub-family Uloborz'fnae.

1) By aecessory claws (πη-(γαρό- spurii, secundarii), I mean those unguiform or
peetinisorm appendages, which in the spiders here spoken of are to be found at the
end of the tarsus, and occasionally also near the ordinary elaw at the extremity of
the palpus of the Ω. They are posited generally under or immediately beside,
though occasionally even above, the genuine elaws (unques veri), from which they are
easily distinguished by not being eurved downwards, but directed straight forward
(outwards), sometimes slightly upward. Generally they are slightly curved in the
manner of an ω, often howeveralmost straight. They are in general smaller, espe-
cially slenderer, than the genuine claws‚ and, like them, are on the under side
(though finer) dentated or serrulated‚ the serrulati0n being sometimes of extreme fine-
ness. They are not always equally developed on the tarsi of the different pairs of
legs. Their number varies greatly: generally there are 2 01· 4, sometimes 6 or even
more (as in the case of Phozeus) on each tarsus, arranged symmetrically near the
