66 T. THORELL,

In the above-cited passage I have more accurately determined the
genus Uloborus so as to include only the species, which can be referred
to the 1st and 2¹³ Races of the 1St Family (⁷’Les Divergentes, Deflectentes⁷⁷)
of that genus in WVALCKENAEP„ (loo. cit). The 1⁵¹² Family’s 3⁸³ Race is the
genus Enfflzatlza (SAV. et Auo), of which more has been said above un-
der the article thraymztlm. The 2²¹³ Family (’⁷les Ecartees, Divaricatoe'’)
of WALoKENAEffs Uloborus forms the genus Zosis WALCK.

DUFOURs statement, cited by LATREILLE1)and LUCAs ²), that U. Walc-
keozaerz'z’ has but one claw upon the three hinder pairs of legs, is entirely
unfounded. The claws in that, as well as in the other species of this ge-
nus, are three in number on each tarsus. In U. IVachenaerz'i the tar-
sal claws are very small, but rather powerful3 of the two superior claws
the inner is considerably thicker at the base than the outer3 on the 1ει pair
of legs the former has at least 5 somewhat curved comb-teeth, gradually
increasing in length, the points of whieh, together with that of the claw, form
au almost straight line: the outer has about 4 teeth, the innermost shortest‚
the others gradually increasing, and the last considerably longer thau the
rest, issuing from about the middle of the claw. The inferior claw is some—
what shorter than the superior, short and thick, strongly curved downwards.
In U. Latrez'lliz' THOR. there is on this claw one long sharp tooth3 in U.
Walekenaerz'z· I have with certainty obser-ved such a tooth on the ΒΜ pair
of legs, and Ι think I have seen one also on the 1st pair. On the 3Πί pair
the claws are shorter, curved more abruptly downwards, and provided with
fewer teeth than on the 1ςι pair.

The female's palpus-claw is weak and of uniform thickness, slightly
curved, with some few (in U. Lati-eilliz' about 5, in U. Costoe THOR. 2 or 3)
weak teeth pointing forwards, nearer the tip. The claws of the palpi thus

end of the joint. They cannot be put in motion by muscles of their own, as is
the case with the genuine elaws, and are in fact to be considered merely as trans-
formed bristles or spines. Beside in the Epeiroidoe‚ I have met with these accessory
claws in Pachyssnatha, in many, especially the larger, species of Lfflypffia, Theri—
dimn, Steatoda etc.‚ as also in Plzolcus. (Cous. THORELL, Till kannedomen om slagtena
Mithras och Uloborus, p. 200).-The accessory claws of Epeira diademata have been
described and figured already in RosEL's Ins. Belust„ IV, p. 252, Tab. XXXIX,
fig. 83 BLACKWALL has also described and figured these claws in the Epeiroz'dae
(Notice of sev. rec. disc. in the struet. and oec. of spid.‚ p. 476, Tab. XIII, fig. 4).
