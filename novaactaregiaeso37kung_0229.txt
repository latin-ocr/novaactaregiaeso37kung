exhibit a considerable similitude of appearance to those of the genus Limy-
plzz‘a in the following family.

Genus 10. HYPTIOTES. (WALCK.). [1833] 1837.
De1·iv.: ὗπτιιὶω, baudra), to be ὕπτιος, leaning back, easy, careless.

Type: Hyptz'otes pccradooeus (C. KOCH).

This genus is first mentioned by lVALCKENAER 1833 in his above
cited Jlle‘moire sur une nouvelle classz'ficatz'on des Amne‘z'des under the name
of Uptiotes, but not otherwise cl1a1·acterized,than that it is erroneously sta-
ted to have six eyes, like Seytodes and Omosites, together with which ge-
nera it is placed in the family ’'Cellulz‘coles'’. It was not till in 1837 1) that
WALCKENAER gave a recognizable, though inaccurate, diagnosis of the ge-
nus ”Uptz'otes⁷’. But during this interval, 1835, the animal, which was the
type of WALCKENAERs Uptz'otes, had been described by O. KOOH under the
name of Mz‘tlzrczs paradooeus (see Synouym.) Under such circumstances it
may seem dubious, which generic name ought to be preserved3 I for my
part should have unreservedly given the preference to the name Alitlzras,
if it had not been previously engaged for another genus of animals3 but
that being the case2), the Walckenaerian name must be adopted.

As Uptz'otes is unquestionably formed from ὕπτιος, resupinus, the name,
as has been already observed in AGAssiZ' Nomemzator Zooloyz'cus‚ must be
written Hyptz'otes.

The systematic position of this genus has been, and still is, a sub-
ject of much dispute. It is remarkable that as long as WALCKENAER and
KOCH believed it to have only 6 eyes, they acknowledged its intimate con-
nexion with the Epeiroidae. KOCH even introduced it into that family 3).
