XVALCKENAEP„ it is true, says (probably on the strength of the imaginary
agreement in the number of the eyes) that his Uptiotes is most nearly rela-
ted to Scytodes, and 116 takes up Koons Makras paradomus — which he
considers different from Uptz'otes anceps —- under the name of Scytodes mithres,-
but 116 nevertheless remarks, that U. anceps approaches very near to the
genus Uloborus ”in the position of the eyes and the form of the cephalo-
thorax'⁷ ¹). Afterwards, in 1847 ²), 116 however maintains, that ”the genus
IIyptioz‘es in its cephalothorax, maxillae and abdomen (22) is intermediate
between the genera leeridz'mn and Aryus⁷', and says not a word of its
relationship 16 Uloborus. He accordingly classes it with the Ther-idioz'doe
(''les Re‘titbles”: loc. cit. p. 527), and is here followed by Sinon, who has
given the genus a place between Ero and Dic-tyna. Excepting the abnor-
mally great distance between the anterior row of eyes 61111 1116 11656 61 1116

to the Epeiroidoe. — KOCH maintains 3), that '’this genus, by the posi-
tion of the eyes, the structure of 1116 body, and by its habits in gene-
ral (2³) belongs to a family of spiders, of which as yet no other genus is
known 16 exist”. Of the habits of this genus Koen seems nevertheless 16
have known nothing. In 1115 Uebers. d. Araclm.-Syst., 5 (1850), 116 66115

nus Polcys (O. KOCH). The family llsz'tlzraz'des takes its place between
Epeirz'des and leerz'dz'des. (Conf. THORELL loc. cit. p. 192).
