ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPmERs. (39

IIyptiotes‚ as far as I am aware, does not possess a single characteristic
in common.

As early as 1856 ¹) I elassed Isyptz'otes or dlz'tlzras among the Epei-
roz’dae, and hare in a later paper 2) developed and expoundcd the grounds
for that view. As Ι there endeavoured to show, the genus Isyptz‘otes ap—
proaehes inore nearly to Cloborus than to any other known genus of spi-
ders, while at the same time by the shorter and robuster form of its body,
its short and broad maxillae, its only slightly tapering extremities, its stou-
ter tarsal and palpa] claws, its two tceth on the inferior tarsa] claw, it
stands in nearer relation to the tyspz'cal Epeiroidae than do the speeies of
woborus. The deviations from them, which Iigsptz'otes exhibits, such as
the presence of the infra-mammillary organ and calamistrum, the distribu-
tion of the eyes into two rows diverffl'ny at the ends, it has also almost all
in common with Floborzcs. A remarkable analogy between Hyptiotes and
the species of Uloborus, with which I am acquainted, is displayed in the
fact that the hairy covering on the sides of the back of the abdomen are
conglomerated into fasaez'cles, arremqed in two rows alonq tlze baele. In Hyp-
times, as in Uloborus, the 4⁸¹ pair of legs is longer than the second⁷ and
the legs are destitute of spines. A pair of accessory claws appear at the ex-
tremity of the tarsus in Hylatfiotes, as well as in Uloborvs and other Epei-
roz'doe. The only character of any consequence, in which fflsptiotes deviates
at once from Floborvs and the Epeirz'noe, appears to me to lie in the great
extent of the eye-area, and its considerable distance from the fore-edge of
the cephalothorax. But a similar relation is also observed in Post-ys O. KOCH
(Plezcromma DOLESCH.), especially as regards the unusually far back loca-
ted position of the posterior side—eyes ³), and that genus seems in this re-
spect to occupy the same relation to Epeira, as Hyptiotes to Clohorns. C.
KOCH united, as has before been said, the genera Poltys and Isyptz'otes in
the same family: the former belongs indisputably to the Epeirinoe, whither
KEYSERLING subsequently referred it, and the latter must with equal cer—
tainty be placed in the most intimate relation to Uloborus.

That even its habits and inclustry claim for Hyptz'otes a place among
the Orbitelariae, will be evidenced by the following lines which we cite from
our above-mentioned paper:
