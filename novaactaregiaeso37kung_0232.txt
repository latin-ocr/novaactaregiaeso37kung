70 T. THORELL,

”In the summer of 1855 I first met with Mithras paradoccus, in the
neighbourhood of Stockhohn, the only part 01 11115 country, in which it has
been obscrved. July, August and September are the months in which it is
met with full-grown. The males are extremely rare, and Ι have as yet
not found more 111311 0116 fully developed. It was taken Aug. 5. The
female 011 1116 contrary is pretty common, and is met with principally 111
11700(15 01 11665 01 1116 111· kind, especially in pine woods. Between the dry
11316 branches 01 11170 neighbouring trees, she spins a strong thread 111 3
horizontal direction, from a point 01 which she afterwards draws obliquely
downwards three other threads, which form equal angles with the original thread
and each other and lie in the same vertical plane. These four threads form
the radii 01 1116 web3 over them are laid concentric cross-threads, 16—22
111 11111111161, and tolerably wide apart. The 10056 1161 111115 constructed forms
a circular 566101· 01 about 45 degrees with a radius 01 3 1001 or 111016. It
15 therefore very large in 111-0110111011 10 1116 spider itself. The animal does
not build 115611 any shelter or nest near the web, 11111 hangs on the first—named
horizontal thread that bears the web, near 0116 01 1116 twigs to which it is
fastened, and at a considerable distance from the common point 01 inter-
section of the radii. The identity of colour between the animal and the dry
brauches causes it not to be so easily perceived: 11 disturbed, it draws in
its legs and lets itsclf down 10 1116 ground. Its movements are slow and
sluggish: the prey, which has fastencd 111 1116 111611, 15 5111111 11110 311 611176-

aware, only by the Epeiroz'doe (according to LUCAS also by Uloborns).⁷'

''Although the web made by Μὶΐήναε paradomzcs 15 50 1166111131 and
so unlike that of every 011161· known species of spider‚ it is easily seen from
the description, that it cannot be looked upon as any separate and inde-
pendcnt form 01 111611, but must be classed under the head of the known
so-called geometrical nets 01 1116 Epeiroidae. Here, as with them, it 6011-
51515 01 radii diverging from a 1101111, united by threads running 60116611111-
cally, the difference is simply that, whereas with the 011161· 51166165 belong-
ing to the family it forms a closed circle, with 1111111133 11 15 11111 ,a
circular sector. A transition to this latter form may in a certain sense be
lookcd 101 111 1116 6356, 01 which one sometimes meets with examples,
where, in the common circular net, the interval between two radii is
left open, by the circular threads being terminated at these radii 1). Not

ches etc. during the voyage of the Beagle, p. 42) in the following words: ”In a
