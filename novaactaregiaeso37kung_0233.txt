ON EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 71

only then in external character, but also in habits and form of web is the
greatest likeness visible between Mitlzras and the Epeiroidae. Hitherto, and
with good reason, the habits of spiders, and especially the form they give their
webs, have been considered as affording the surest basis for a natural grou-
ping and elassification of these 3111111315; 311(1 as, in all probability, all the
species that belong to the family Epeiroidae distinguish themselves by their
power of spinning regular geometrica] webs ¹) —— 011 which account that fa-
mily received from LATREILLE the name of Orbitelae —— and in short one never
assigns to any other family a speeies, which is known to spin 511611311612),
it seems evident that the genus Mamm-as ought to be included in the Epei-
roidae, although it must be placed last among 1116111, nearest to the genus
Uloboww, with which it also best agrees in the looseness of its web.”

The limit between this and the next following sub-order, Tzcbitelarz'ae,

the insect had its station3 but only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrieal

1) We should perhaps except the genus Doloplzoizes, if that genus really belong
to the Epeiroidae (Conf. WALCK. H. N. d. Ins. Apt.‚ Ι, p. 383), and, according 10
SUNDEVALL (Consp. Aracha, p. 13), an East Indian species of Epeira, which he calls
E. abnormis, but does not describe: it is said to spin 311 irregular net. Of Aa-yyvo-
