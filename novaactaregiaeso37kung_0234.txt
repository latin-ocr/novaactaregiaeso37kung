7 2 T. THORELL,

Uroctea for ex. might with almost as good reason be referred to the one
as to the otiien—Of the characteristic features of this sub-order the
following ought to be observed: the extremities are, with few exceptiones,
fine and slender, and provided with in general weak, serrated or pectinated
tarsal claws: there is almost always au inferior tarsal claw, sometimes toothless,
sometimes armed with one or two, never more, teeth. The palpal claw in
the fcmales is generally weak, serrated or pectinated, but often without
tceth: sometimes it is rudimentary or even entirely absent. The hairy co-
vering is thin3 the markings of the abdomen depcnd upon the colour of the
skin‚ not upon that of the hairy covering. The eyes (in all European spe-
cics) form typically two transversal rows, but sometimes the intermediary
eyes, especially of the males in certain genera (Avyyrodes‚ Linyphz'a‚ Wala-
lcenaera) of the family Theridz'oidoe, are drawn, 011 account of the unusual
development of the pars cephalica of the cephalothorax, out of their ordi-
nary regular position. There is no infra-mammillary organ or calamistrum.

The spinners are — excepting in the Enyoz'doe, in which the inferior spin-
ners are considerably longer than the others — short and of almost

equal length, and consist of only two joints. —- See also above p. 47.

We divide the spiders that compose this sub-order, which very
nearly corresponds to LATREILLE·S cheqm'celoe or SUNDEVALL·S Uzerz'dz'des,
into tinec families, Thericlioidae, Scytodoz'doe and Enyoidoe, which may be
thus distinguished:

I. Mamillae inferiores (anteriores) reliquis non vel parum longiores.

1. Tarsi articulo unguifero libero carentes. Labium liberum. Mandibulae
non ad basin coalitae ............. Ι. Theridz'oz'doe.

2. Tarsi articulo libero unguifero aucti. Labium cum sterno plerumque sine
sutura coalitum. Mandibulae versus basin plerumque inter se unitae.

. .................. Π. Scytodoz'dae.

Π. Mamillae inferiores reliquis multo longiores ....... ΙΙΙ. Enyoicloe.

punctam and castanea are typical of the genus Steatocla Smm, the third, Ε. atriea,
is an Epeiroid spffler, belonging to Kocfl's genus Zz‘lla, and standing so near his
Z. montana and Z. calophylla = Z. oe-notata (CLERCK) both in form, coloul· and ha-
bits, that all three are considered hy WALCK. and SUNDEV. as belonging to the
same species.⁷’ — G. Kocn’s mistake with respect to the systematic position of the
Epeiroidae here mentioned has in fact been observed and corrected by almost all sub-
sequent writers.
