The European spiders belonging to this family, as well 111 111011· ha-
bits, the construction of their webs and the form they give their cocoons,
as 111 111011· general appearance, cxhibit very considerable differences, but
yet form a perfectly compact and natural group, which it is not easy to
resolve even into tolerably well-defined sub-families. N evertheless BLACKWALL
has divided them into two separate familiae, Linyphiidoe and Thwidiiclce,
but without indicatiug any difference of bot-lily form between these two fa-
milies. They are said to be distinguishable however by the different man-
ner in which the species composing them construet their webs: the Limy-
phiz‘dae fabricate a fine sheet 01 web, the suares 01 1110 leeridiidae on the
contrary are said to consist 01 111100 intersecting 0110 another 111 different
planes and at various angles, and to present the appearance of being con-
structed without any regular plan 1). Even if this basis for their classification
could be admitted, which seems to me dubious, it not being taken from the
animals themselves, I still think it does not, 11 strictly applied, lead to a na-
tural grouping. Its application would probably in many cases be impossible,
for the webs of many species belonging to BLACKWALL'S Walclcenaera and Ne-
riene are unknown, and it seems to me probable, that these do not all
construet webs resembling those 01 Πηῃρήία, nay that some 01 them fabri-
cate none at all. Steatoda bz'punetata and castanea, Lz'tlzyphcmtes coronatus
and others, belonging to BLACKWALL’S leerz'clz'on, weave nets not indeed 00
close and fine as those of the Linyphiee, but which yet have the form 01 a
sheet, and are quite as regular as theirs, and these species surely no one
would think of separating from the Theridiidae. Other authors also have
endeavoured to separate between Theridfidae and Linyphiidae, but it is vain
to look for any agreement as to which genera are to be assigned to the
one or 011101· 01 111000 groups. SIMON refers rllz'cryphaoztes to the Linyphiidae, but
Erigone 10 1110 T heridiz'cloe: by BLACKWALL on the other hand the 01100100
composing both these genera are referred 10 1110 Linyplziidae. MENGE, who
