74 T. THORELL,

divides his ⁷⁷ Netzsphmen, Ratiariae⁷' into three families, Paclzyynathidoe, Li-
nyphidae and leericlidQ of which the two latter are distinguished by the
form of their webs, just as in BLACKWALL‚ refers to the Linyplzz'doe those spiders
only, which belong to WESTRING⁷S Linyplzia and Tapinopa, thus exclusling
both the Erzyone- and illicryphantes-species, which he makes Theoffclidce.
According to MENGE‚ the Pachyqnatlzidae do not make any web, but both
WVESTRING ¹) and BLACKWALL ²) speak of their webs as being irrepulws and
the latter says of Pach. Clerclc-z'z', that it is related with leeridz'um ⁷³ by the
irregularity of the scanty web which it spins⁷⁷: nevertheless BLACKWALL aggre-
gates this genus to the Linyplziicloe, not to the Thericliz’doe. It having thus
been found impl-acticable to assign any certain line of separation between
Theridiidae and Linyphiidae either 111 1110 form of the body or the appearance
of the web, Ι have (in company with WESTRING and OHLERT) not considered
the latter as either a family or sub-family separate from the former.
Also XVALCKENAER who had at first distinguished them under the names
of ''Batiam” (Theridiidae) and ''sl‘apz’zealeffl’ (Linyphiidae), subsequently uni-
ted them under the denomination Re'tz‘tdes ³). Neither needs Paclzyynatha be
separated from them, although that genus certainly deviatcs a little from the
typical Theridioidae, as is the case also with Ερίείηηε, which genus is by
some (e. g. SIMON and OHLERT) included in the family leomisoz'dae.

Ο. KOOH’S division of his Theridides ¹³) into 5 sub-families (”Beutel-
spimzen”‚ Wandspz‘mzen”‚ ''Eiyentlz'ehe Webspz'nnmz”‚ ⁷*Striclcerspimzeff' and
'⁷B0‹;Zenspimzen⁷') is altogether impracticable and full of gross errors. Epei-
roidae and Drassoidae occur there mixed up with real Theridioidae in a man—
ner, which is utterly unaccountable. —— SIMON divides his '’lee‘ridz'ormes”
into three ''tribus⁷’: '’Clodzdieuzs'ss '’I-'he‘rz‘clz'ens”‚ and ''Li'nyphz‘ens'ffi the first
of these appears to us 10 form two separate families‚ which we call anoidae
and Urocteoz'clae, and of which we only refer the former to the Retitelarioe,
whereas the Urocteoidoe may perhaps better be united with the next sub-
order, the Ττιόἱῑείανὶίω 1110 The‘rz‘diem and Linyphiens together correspond
very nearly with our Thericlioidoe and Αραῖεηοὶιῖω, which last SIMON has
united with his Linyphz'ens. Of Iffyptiotes and Didyma, which he aggregates
to his Thermaeus, we include the former genus in the Uloborince of the fa-
mily Epeiroidoe‚ and the latter in the Avmcmrobiinae of the family Ayalenoidae.—
MENGE ⁵) refers not only Didyma (and Lethz'a) but also Hahnia to his The-
rididae3 we unite this latter genus with the genuine Ayaleninoe.
