WESTRING‚ BLACKWALL, MENGE and others have already remarked
1116 61066 analogy between this genus and Y‘et22agyizaz‘lz.‹i among the Epeiroidae
111 1116 structure of the inale's palpi, the forn] of the mandibles⁷ ete: it was
even referred by SUNDEVALL‚ when he first described 11, 10 1116 ⁷⁷Retiariae⁷’
i. e. the Epeiroz'doe. -—- The superior tarsa] elaws are in this genus rather
large and powerful, yet slender, pretty 111111011111)Υ eui-ved, strongly peefflnated,
with several (12 or less> long, straight teeth3 the inferior elaw is small,
with one very small blunt 100111. The palpal elaw in Q is under the
middle provided with a few close-set teeth gradually inereasing in length.

A remarkable genus⁷ whieh by the form of its large diverging man-
dibles seems 10 116 related 10 Paclzyfflzcttlm, is Proclidomus HENTZ (Aran.
of the United States7 in Bost. ι1011111. of Nat. Hist.‚ V, p. 4660: it is said
to show ⁷'some of the characters of Olubiona and TImz'dz'uw'&

Type: Fomzz'cz'na Mutinensis CANESTR.

This to me unknown genus is said by CANESTRINI 10 116 related to
Pachygynatlza: it has however not the mandibles diverging almost at a right
angle, but only slightly diverging at the extremities. The most distinguish-
ing feature of the genus 16, that the petiolum, whieh unites the cephalo-
thorax and abdomen, is long and nodose, thus giving these spiders a certain
resemblance with ants. The 4 intermediary eyes form a trapezium: the po-
sterior pair are farther distant from the side-eyes than from each other3
the anterior are so close as almost to touch each other. The side-eyes are
contigimus, the cephalothorax tolerably long and narroW3 the relative length
of the legs: 1, 2, 3, 4. See CANESTR.‚ 106. 611.; Aran. Ita1.‚ p. 118.
