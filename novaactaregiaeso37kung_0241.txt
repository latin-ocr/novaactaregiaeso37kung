The natural place of this genus is still a matter of controversy.
LATRE1LLE included it among his ‚Inseqnitelw also WALCKENAER ¹) and Lucas‘ss')
place it near the genus Theridz'mn, and they are here followed by WESTRING
and BLACKWALL3 the last-named author does not even look upon it as ge-
nerically differing from leerz’dium WALCK. C. KOCH also at first 3) refer-
red it to his '’Theridides’'‚ but subsequently 4) gave it a place among 1110
Epeiroiclce, probably on account of a certain similitude of appearance with
Tetragynatlm. Both its industry and the form of its extremities however
remove Episz'nvs both from the Epeiroidoe and the Thamisoidoe, to which latter
this genus is referred not only by SIMON (loe. 011.) but also by OHLERT 5), who
had nevertheless previously 6) (1001511011, 011 the ground of the number and
structure of the tarsal claws7 his conviction, that it ought to be classed
among the T lzerz'clioz‘doe, which all, like the Epeimidae, have three claws at
the extremity of the tarsus, whereas the Thomisoidae have only two. From
this last family Ejaz'sz'nus differs also, and that essentially⁷ in 1101 being in

7) OHLERT indeed (with LATREILLE) includes also the leonzz'soz'dce in the list of
Awssaneae sedentes, but he does not give 10 that expression the sense we think it ought
to bear. Only such spiders ought to be called ⁷'sedentes’' or ”sedenta1-y'⁷, as await
their prey in a wel) 01· nest, in eontradistinction to those wich wandel· about in

titelarz'oe and some Tabitelarz'oe (Filistatoz'dce, certain Dysderoidse, aud most, if not
all, Ayalenoidoe): the others, and especially Lateriffl’ccdoe, Citiaradoe and Saltiqradce‚
