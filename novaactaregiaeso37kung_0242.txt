80 Τ. THORELL,

soidae, a wandering spider, whose web however appears to consist merely
of a few irregular threads, on which it sits with its legs stretched straight
forwards and backwards, in much the same position as Tetraynatka. — The
male by his large palpa] clava resembles the Hyptiotes paradomcs 0².

The superior tarsal claws are slender‚ slightly curved‚ with about
5 curved saw-teeth between their basis and middle, gradually increasing in
length (on the 1st pair of legs)3 the inferior claw is very small, with the
extremity curved a little outwards, and has two blunt teeth3 the femaIe's
palpus-claw is small, more strongly curved, and has about 6 close-set saw-
teeth of about the same form as on the superior claws of the tarsi.

Type: Aryyrodes Epez'rae SIMON.

This genus, formed with good reason by SIMON at the expense of
Linyphz'a WALOK.‚ is especially remarkable for its living parasitically in
the webs of larger Epeiroz'doe. SIMoN has lately 1) under the name of Aryy-
rodes Epeiroe described a species from Spain, which he considers as new, but
which certainly is identical with Linyphz'a aryyrodes WALCK.‚ of which I have
seen specimens from Brazil7 and which is also met wdth in the Ile de la
Reunion (Bourbon) ²) and probably also in Java3) and in Georgia in North
America4). It appears to be as widely geographically distributed as Cyrtoplzora
opzmtz'oe (DUF.)‚ in the web of which, according to SIMON, it in Spain resides.
— On this genus see also above p. 48.

The tarsal claws of A. Epeiroe are somewhat weak (as in Linyphia);
the two superior differ considerably from each other in size‚ and are pro-
vided with 2 or 3 teeth of unequal size, pointing obliquely forward (on
the 1St pair of legs). The inferior claw is equally large with the greater
of the superior claws, more powerful, with a long, pointed tooth. The fe-
male’s tarsal claw is fine and slender, slightly curved⁷ with two teeth of
different size pointing obliquely foi-ward.
