Now that SUNDEVALL has separated Pachyynatlza, WESTRING Tepi-
nopa, and SIMON Aoyyrodes from LATREILLE'S mummia, it appears 10 1116
11161 611 1116 remaining European 51166165 referred by XVALCKENAER to this
genus, excepting only L. cryptz‘eolens WALCK. (Nesticus cellulam& (OLERCK)
NOB.)‚ may be retained under that generic name. C. 1ζοοΗ 1165 removed from
it and made a separate genus of Bolyphao'zteS, 111 which 116 61 first also in-
cluded a couple of 51166165 of the genus Chiracanfflz'zmz, which he however
since removed from that place. I cannot persuade myself that the genus
Bolgsphantes is sufficiently distinctly characterised to deserve 10 116 retained,
although it has been adopted by OHLERT and some others. The number of
166111 011 1116 11611161 616117, 011 which OHLERT appears 10 lay 1116 principal
stress in determining the limits of Linyplzz'a and Bolyphantes, affords a
characteristic 1166111161· only to the female, and moreover that number is 100
different in the most nearly related species (8 111 6. g. Bol. or Lm. ahiceps,
3 or 4 in Bel. alpestris or Lin. luteola BLAOKW.) 10 116 allowed any great
importance3 neither can I find in the position of the eyes any constant dif-
ference between these two genera.

BLAOKWALL 1165 combined certain 51166165 of lVALCKENAEffS Limy-
plzz'a with some tornis of that 1171·1161·’ 5 Α19ῑιε 01· XVES'LRINGS Erz'yone into a
sepaiate genus Neriene, which appears 10 me 10 include elements to differ-
ent 10 be natmal. Even had it been natulffal there was no occasion for a
new 1161116, for it contains 51166165, which had already received from SAVIGNY
and AUDOUIN the generic name of Eriyone. Judging from the characters
assigned by BLACKWALL to Linyphia and Neriene, it would seem that the
latter genus differs from the former principally in having the 1⁵t and 4¹¹⁴
pairs of legs equally Zony or nearly so, whereas in Lz'nyplzz'a the 1⁵² pair is

01· curved towards the 1111 111 Neriene, straight or slightly inclined towards
the lip and somewlzat quadram in Linyphz'a. The genus D'Valclcemzerm accor-
