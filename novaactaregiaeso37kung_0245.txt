dilatecl at the base. On the difference in the form of the maxillae BLACK-
WALL appears however to have laid no especial weight, for his Neriene
lonffl'palpz's for ex. has unquestionably the maxillae strongly dilated at the
base, and the maxillae of Neriene trilineata do not, as far as I can 500, differ
111 form from for eX. those of Linyphz'a montana (CLERCR). The distinction
then must 110 founded 011 the difference in the relative length of the legs3
and the consequence is, that species so heterogeneous as for ex. Neriene
(Eri-cyon& Zoivyz'jmlpis and N. trilineata (Lin. buccnlenta) have been united in
one genus with N. inaminata (Lin. clathrata Simo), which accordingly is
made not to belong to the same genus as for ex. Linyphz'a pratensis
BLACKW.! That too much weight ought not in these genera to be laid 011 the
characteristics derived from the relative length of the legs and a somewhat
different form of the 111311111εο7 1135 nevertheless not escaped the observation
of BLACKWALL‚ for 110 himself says in his account of his rVerz‘ene dubia (p.
289) that even ”the sexes of the same spider frequently differ in the rela-
tive length of the legs and in the form of the maxillae''. — The genus
Neriene ought, in my opinion, to be wholly suppressed and its species dis-
1111101οᾶ among Linyphia‚ Walckenaera and Eriyone, in such wise that the
species that have scattered spines on their legs 110 assigned to Lz'nyphia7 and
of the others those, of which the maxillae are greatly dilated at the base,
to Eri90ne‚ and the rest to Walclcenaera.

The numerous genera which MENGE has separated from Linypha'a,
I cannot adopt, as they appear to me almost exclusively based upon minute
modifications of the organs of copulation 1), frequently only discoverable by
means of the microscope. Compare what we have said on this subject in
our remarks on the genus Epeira‚ p. 54.

1) This of course does not prevent our acknowledgement of the great importanee
of MENGE'S researches on the subject of the more detailed structure of the sexual or-
gans, which previous to him had been almost entirely unknown, and wherehy a new
and highly interesting field for investigation has been opened. It is probable that
the results obtained by this species of research will have a certain influence on the
classification of spiders, as soon as they have obtained a wider compass, and a
richer 51010 of materials of observation has been accumulated. But as yet it is per-
haps too early to attempt to deduce from the modifications of these organs the de-
cisive characteristics of yerzera, for we have as yet too little knowledge of what
connexion these modifications have with the different form or arrangement of other
organs of acknowledged systematic weight‚ 0. g. the parts of the mouth, the extre-
mities 'and the eyes. It appears to us, that similarities or dissimilarities in the struc-
ture of the organs of copulation is far from always indicating a corresponding simi-
litude or dissimilitude in the organisms generally3 at least species which are very
