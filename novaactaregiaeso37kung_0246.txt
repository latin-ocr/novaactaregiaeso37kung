Lz'nyphz'a passes gradually into Walclcenaera (Illicryplzoentes), and only
a tolerably artificial limit can be established between these two genera,
however unlikc each other they 011 the whole may be. We admit, with
WESTRING, that the presence of scattered spinas on the legs is the mark which
distinguishes Lifnyphia from Walckenaera (and Eriyone), in preference to the
distinction proposed by OHLERT‚ the presence of palpal claws in Linyphia‚
and the absence of them in Walckenaera (and Eriyone). In fact⁷ the cha-
racter deduced from the spines on the legs is easily verified⁷ whereas the
palpal claw in some oi the smallcr Linyphiae is so fine and slender as to
be very difficult to distinguish from an ordinary 11115110, and furthermore the
presence or absence of a claw on the palpus is a characteristic applicable
only to one sem, the female. Besides, Eriyone vayans SAV. et AUD. is said
10 be, unlike other species of that genus, provided with a palpal claw 1),
and of the genus Carmina MENGE, which we unite with U’alckenaera or
Mieryphances‚ Ο. brevis, according to MENGE (as well as WEsTRING’S Eri-

closely related in every thing else (e. g. the species of the genus Zilla (KocH)
WESTR.) show very considerable differences with respect to the organs in question,
and this has caused newer arachnologists with predilection to deduce the distinctions
of speeies from the almost endlessly varying forms of the palpi of the males and. the
⁷⁷epigyne'’ or vulva of the females. — Science however must necessarily gain by every
endeavour after an improved classification and a sharper distinction of the genera of
spiders. It is indisputabie, that Arachnology stands in a much lower position than
most other branches of Entomology‚ and that especially the scientific diagnosis of fa-
milies and genera is as yet very defective. More than one arachnologist of the pre-
sent time content themselves with WALCKENAER'S system, and follow in their descrip-
tions the method of that princeps araclmoloyorum, whose honour one by no means
depreciates by not beheving, that the science ought always to remain stationary at the
point, to which be carried it and where he left it. Only a few of the few, who de-
vote themselves to this branch of zoology, labour to promote it by other means than
by increasing the number of better 01· worse descriptions of specics. Of late years
however signs of a better spirit have shown themselves, and among the works which
rise above the ordinary level, those of MENGE undoubtedly occupy a particularly
high place. But many workmcn are still wanted upon that so slightly cultivated
field, and in order 10 obtain these, it is necessary in the first place to make fauni-
stic and descriptive works in general as easy to use and as practical as possible.
As long as good and sufficient marks of distinction can be found by the aid of the
simple magnifying lens, one must not make the compozmcl microscope an indispensable
instrument for any one⁷ who may wish to determine the name and systematic posi-
tion of an unknown spider. That the microscope is not necessary in order with cer-
tainty to distinguish even the smallest species of spiders, is fully evidenced by the

works of WESTRING and OHLERT. ,
