gyone plaoeopus, which belongs to Carmina) is destitute of palpal clavvs ¹),
whereas other species of Carmina described by MENGE are provided with them.

The superior tarsal claws in the Linyplzioe are slender, slightly curv-
ed, and have generally 6—12, sometimes even up to nearly 20, pointed
teeth, gradually increasing in length3 the inferior claw on the contrary has
only one or two pointed teeth. The female's palpal claw has usually one,
two or no teeth, sometimes, but rarely, 3—8 short saw-tceth. In many of
the smaller species it is very slender, and sometimes entirely absent.

Type: Eriyone νίφα-ηε SAV. et AUD.

Of the species included by WESTRING in the genus Eriyonffi we pre-
serve under that generic name only those, which are distinguished by hav-
ing the maxillae consiclerably clz'laz‘ed at the base, short, and inclined towards
the lip. Eriyooze NOB. accordingly corresponds to the 1St race (’'les Eriyo-
nides⁷’) of the 1St family of Aryzcs WVALCK. In that compass, which appears
to be what by SAVIGNY and AUDOUIN was originally intended, it corresponds
very nearly with O. KOCH'S, SIMON’S and OHLER'r'S Eriyone, although the
last mentioned author gives as the special characteristic of the genus the
long] palpi of the male, a characteristic then, that applies only to one seX.
ln WESTRING this genus corresponds to Eriyone and fllieryplzantes together
