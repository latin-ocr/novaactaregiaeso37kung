Type: Walckenaera acuminata BLACKW. (= E2·i907ze cornuta (REUSS)
wisa-a).

The name Illicryplzantes we find first, and without charactm'satsiofn,
applied by O. KOCH in the 121ει Number of HERRICH-SCHAEFFER'S Deutseh-
lands Insecten, which appeared in 1833 (or perhaps not before 1834). In
1833 BLACKWALL (loc. cit.) published his genus Walclcenaera accompanied
by a complete diaynosis: under this name he united a number of speeies,
which, as it appears from the characterization of sslicryplzcmtes, subsequently
given by KOCH (in Uebers. d. Arachn. Syst. 1, p. 11 (1837), and Die
Araelm., IV, p. 124—127), also belong to that genus. Walclcenaera and
Blimyplzam‘es are accordingly to be looked upon as synonyms3 and from
What now has been adduced it is easily perceived, that the first name is
to be preferred to the latter, even if not older them, but only contempora-
neous with it.

The genus Savifflwz'a was formed by BLACKWALL for a spider (S.
frontata BLACKW. = Eriy. com'ca WESTR.) which he erroneously supposed
to have but six eyes, but which 116 has since rightly aggregated to Walc-
Icenaera. —— To Neriene, besides many other species, he has referred seve-
ral, that stand in 50 61056 connexion with the spiders that he attributes to
'Walclcenaerm that it seems to us, that they ought to be assigned to that
genus. O. KOCH referred those of them, with which he was acquainted,
to his illicryphantes. Walcleenaem (BLACKW.) NOB. is therefore very nearly
identical with Illicryplzames C. KoeH, which genus has been adopted by

1) Elaphidz'on SERV. [Coleopt.] 1834.
