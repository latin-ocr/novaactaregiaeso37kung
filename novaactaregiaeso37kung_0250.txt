many arachnologists, SIMON and OHLERT among the rest—Of the value of
the distinctions that separate Neriene from Walcleenaera and Linyphz'a we
have already delivered an opinion (p. 82—83).

While Wrsrmne unites into one genus, Eriyone, the specics that
compose Kocn's Eriyone and Illicoyplzaoztes, the large number of species, of
which the latter genus consists, and which makes a division of it desirable,
has given occasion to two attempts of the kind, which however do not seem
to us to have been attended by fully satisfactory results. SIMON divides
Allicryphantes (loe. cit.) into the sub-genera M'z'crgsphantes, illelicertus, Pele-
copsz'.3‚ Nerienem, Widerz'us and Arrecerus, in consequence of more ΟΥ less
accurately observed differences in the form of the head and the position of
the eyes in the males. He however already at the end of the same work
discards (Walckevnaera and) Nerienem. MENGE, in his '⁵ Preussische Spinnen'',
resolves the genus Micryplmntes or Walclcemzera into a very large number
of new genera, but does not adopt any of SIMON'S or BLAOKWALL’S here ci-
ted names. Several of these genera are founded 011 characteristics belong—
ing only to the males, others on modifications, which appear to me of too
subordinate importance to be used as the characteristics of genera. Some
of them, however, may perhaps deserve to be acknowledged. But as the
3¹¹¹ Part of MENGE'S work, in which many of his new genera are proposed,
did not come out till shortly before the present sheet was sent to the
press, I cannot now enter into any detailed cxamination of his elassification
of the spiders in question, but preserve for the present the genus Walclce-
mrem undivided, and of the extent above named.

The weak and slender superior tarsa] claws of the species compos-
ing the genus Walclcenaera have usually 6-8 teeth, greatly varying in
length3 the inferior claw has one, rarely two pointed teeth. The palpal
claw is absent, except in the case of a few species (belonging to the genus
Ceratina MENGE), in which it has 1—3 teeth. Conf. MENGE, Preuss. Spin-
