Type: Nesticus cellulanns (CLERCK).

The different genera, to which CLERCK'S Aram. cellulaoms has been
referred by different araohnologists, sufficiently indicate that it does not
fully agree with any 0116 of them. By VVALCKENAER it was first classed
among the Thericlia, afterwards among the Linyplzz'ce. To the Epeiroz'd
genus Meta, to which it is assigned by O. KOCH‚ it of course does not
belong. The position of the eyes is the same as in Linyplzicz, but their
form, the absence of spines 011 1116 legs, and the form of the cephalothorax,
seem to vindicate for this spider a place nearer the genus {Theridium WALCK.‚
and especially near Stentoda (SUND.) NOB. In the form of the maxillae 1131)-
pears to me to stand midway between Lz’nyplzz'a and Steatoda. Accordingly,
as it cannot properly be united to either of these genera, Ι have formed a
new genus for its reception.

The superior tarsal claws, which are long, slender, and slightly
curved‚ have 111 Nestieus cellulamcs about 11—-13 closely set, rather short
comb-teeth‚ gradually increasing in length and pointing somewhat forwa1·ds;
the inferior has two close-set blunt teeth, of which the exterior is con-
siderably thicker 111311 1116 interior. The palpa] elaw has about 13 166111,
similar to those of the superior tarsal claws. The armature of the claws is
thus very peculiar and different from what we meet with either 111 Linyphz'a7
Theridium or Stentoda.
