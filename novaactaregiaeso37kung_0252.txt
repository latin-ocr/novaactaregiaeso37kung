90 T. THORELL‚

We take this genus, formed by O. ΚΟΟΗ, in the extent which Wsss-
TRING has assigned it7 and accordingly cannot include in it Ero samatilz's
O. KOCH, which is a Ther-idiunt (= Th. riparium BLACKW.). — The tar-
sus in this genus shows at least some appearance of a little separate joint
bearing the claws, and by this, as well as by its highly convex cephalothomx,
Ero shows an evident analogy with Scytodes. - The superior tarsal claws are
weak, sharply bent downwards, with 3 or 4 small teeth towards the base3
the inferior claw appears to me to have only one little tooth. The palpal
claw has the same form as the superior claws of the tarsi, and 3 or 4 ‘teeth

rapidly increasing in length and directed somewhat forward, situated nearly
under the middle of the claw (in E. varieyata).

Type: Plzyllonetkz's lineata (CLERCK).

CLERCK'S Araneus lineatus differs ΞΟ lal'gely from the typica] {Uze-
rz‘dz'a (if we consider as such Th. sisyphium, varians, and their nearest re-
lations) that, unless the great genus Theridiztm WALCK. be preserved un-
divided, it can hardly be classed among them. WALCKENAER himself formed
for this speeies a special '’family’' of his Theridium: C. KOOH formed
for it a separate genus, to which he erroneously affiliated Th. pictum WALOK.‚
a spider which accurately agrees with the above-mentioned typical species
of Theridz'um. MENGE‚ who adopts the new genus, restricts it to the spe-
eies in question, Ar. lineatus CLERCK. By C. KooH it has been denomi-
nated Steatoda, which name however belongs to quite another group of The-
ridioidae (see Gen. 14. Stemma, p. 93). MENGE calls it Theo-idiunt, but
that name had previously been by SIMON reserved for Th. sisyphium and
its nearest allied species (which again are by MENGE taken up under the
name of steatoda), and ought, according to the law of priority, to be preser-
ved to them. I have therefore been obliged to give the genus a new name.
