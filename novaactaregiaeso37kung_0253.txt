ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPmERs. 91

Τ110 superior tarsal claws are tolerably large, armed with about 5
teeth, of which the two exterior ones a-re long and divergent3 the palpal
claw has 5 teeth increasing in length, and of which the 3 exterior are
crooked and somewhat diverging. The inferior tarsal claw has a thick,
blunt, somewhat crooked tooth and an inconsiderable point behind it.

Gen. 12. DIPOENA N.

Type: DzPoerza melawzoyaster (C. KOCH).

We have formed this genus for Area nzelanoyctster C. KOCH (Ther.
conyener OAMBR.)‚ which is not an Area at all, not even an Epeiroid, as
C. KOCH maintains (loc. cit). From Theridam, to which this genus ap-
proaches more nearly than to any other, and to which the only yet known
species is referred by OAMBRIDGE (100. cit.)1')‚ it differs principally by the
posterior row of eyes being curved baekwards, and by the coarse bristles
with which the legs are armed.

In the only known species the height of the clypeus is almost greater
than the length of the mandibles, more than 1} times, nearly double as great
as the length of the area occupied by the central eyes. The almost spherical
abdomen is slightly emarginate or hollowed out at the base. The tarsal
claws are rather strong, but small, especially the inferior, which has
one tolerably long tooth3 the superior are armed with a row of short saw-
teeth proceding from the side of the claw and pointing obliquely forwards,
which row reaches nearly to the tip of the claw. The female's palpal claw
is bent almost exactly to a half-circle, small, and tolerably powerful; I have
not been able to see any teeth on it. The construction of the claws is
then, in this genus, very unlike that in the genus Thericlium.

1) Even Anssmmss, though he includes it in his genus Atea, else consisting only
of Epeiroidae, says, that, on account of its f0rm7 it must necessarily be considered a
Theridium. (Die Arachn. Tirols, Ι, p. 150). The weh of this spider seems to be γ
as yet unknown.
