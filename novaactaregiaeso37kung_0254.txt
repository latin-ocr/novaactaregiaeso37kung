If the great Latreilleian genus Linyphz'a forms a close and compact
whole, from which only a few speeies need be detached and divided among
more recently formed genera, this is by no means the ease with Theridizcm
WALOK. WALOKENAER himself, already in his Tableau des Araneides, di-
vided it into several ’'families''‚ most of which form perfectly natural groups,
and have been raised to the rank of independent genera by O. KooH, who
has been followed in this by OHLERT and others. Most of these two wri-
ters' genera Ι have thought it best to retain, though with some slight mo-
difications3 moreover I have adopted the genus Euryopis proposed by
MENGE‚ and have added the new genus Dipoena ΝΟΒ. (for Atea melaozoya-
ster: see preceding page). The name leerz'dium Ι have⁷ according to the
example of (O. KOCH and) SIMON‚ preserved for WALCKENAER'S ”3¹ne Fam.
les Renfle‘es⁷'‚ which family appears to me to include the forms specially ty-
pical of his leeridz'um. By MENGE this genus has been called Stemma, a
name belonging to a quite different group (see following genus). His The-
rz'dz'um is our Phyllonethis (566 p. 90). For T lz. bimaeulatmn (LlNN.)⁷ MENGE
has formed the genus Neottz'um, which Ι have thought it 11651 10 1111116
with leeridium. Th. yuttatum Reuss, which has been looked upon as a
Ther-idimon by OHLERT, but for which MENGE has proposed a separate gemm,
Crustulz'na, ought, it appears to me, to be referred to the same genus as
Ar. szmnctata LINN.‚ i. e. to Stecctoda (SUND.).

WESTRING and BLACKWALL preserve for Thai-idiunt about the same
limits that it has 111 VVALCKENAER, the latter even refers Episz‘nus WALcK.

to it.
