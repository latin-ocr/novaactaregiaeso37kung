In T lzerz'dz'um the claws are small and weak, the superior tarsal
claws ordinarily provided with 5 or 6 teeth gradually increasing in length,
of which the extreme ones are long, pointed and somewhat curved3 the in—
ferior is not much smaller than the superior claws, with one short, blunt,
somewhat curved tooth, and frequently a little point behind it3 the palpal
claw has most generally 4—7 rather long pointed teeth.

le. tepidariornw, formosum and rzjmrz'mn eompose a little separate
group, distinguished, as OHLERT has already remarked, also by some differences
in the forn] of the palpal claw: that claw in these species is in fact strongly
bent, with about 7 (in le. tepz'darz'orum 10) long, close-set, vertical teeth,
which, together with the downward bent ext-remity of the claw, form a
comb. The tarsal claws also are somewhat stouter than those of the other
species of the genus.

Type: Steatoda castanea (CLERCK).

O. KOCH, by an unaccountable mistake, has used the name Stentocla
for leeridz'mn lineatum, which, together with T lz. sisyphium and Zowyz’ma-
num (tinctum WALOK.), SUNDEVALL (loe. cit.) has expressly cited as examples
of the species he allows to remain under the genus lerz‘clz’um, after having
therefron] separated Steatoda. According to SUNDEVALL'S characteristics of
this genus, ”Th. d-pzcnctatunz’' and ‘'Th. castmzeum⁷’ must be considered
as its types, and these species are also the first entered by him as thereto
belonging3 afterwards he names ”Th. albo-maculatmn” (which we look upon
