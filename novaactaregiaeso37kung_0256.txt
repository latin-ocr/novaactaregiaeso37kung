as the type of a separate genus, Lithyphantes NOB. = Phrurolichus (G. KOCH)
OHLERT), and lastly ”Th. lunatum⁷’, which however approaches nearer to
Th. sisyphz'zmz than to ''Tlt 4-pmzctatmn'', and is also by most recent arachss
nologists (lately by MENGE) referred to the same genus as the former of
these two species. Sceatoda (SUND.) ought then to be considered as very
nearly synonymous with Eucharia (C. KOOH) OHL. — In Rec. crit. 31311,
p. 108 (1856), Ι adopted the genus Steatoda in the full extent it had re-
ceived from SUNDEVALL, i. e. as comprising St. hipunctata and castanea, as
also some species, which Ι 111611 supposed ought to be united in the same
genus with these, 3 6011111355 which however, as has been said, must be
considerably curtailed. MENGE has afterwards used the generic name 81611-
toda for Th. sisyphium 616, which according to what 1135 here been shown,
is not right, the species of Steatoda (SUND.) are by him called Eucharia.—

Zilia (O. KOCH) WESTR.——Thc name Stecatoda has 1116 right of priority in
preference to Eucharia, which moreover had already in 1816 been assigned
by HUBNER to a genus of Lepidoptera.

The claws of Steacoda are far more powerful 111311 111056 of Theri-
dz’mn, but still tolerably long. The free end of the superior tarsa] olaw is
somewhat thickened about the middle, the teeth are thick, not long, gener—
ally 7—8 in number, the inferior tarsal claw has one blunt tooth. The
11311131 claw has ordinarily about 6-7 166111, gradually increasing in length,
and pointing forwards. — Such 15 1116 6356 111 S. castanea and bipzmctata.
