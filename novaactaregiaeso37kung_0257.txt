ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 95

If from C. KOCH’S heterogeneous genus Plzrurolithus we detach some
not allied forms, as for instance Ph. trg‘s'ascz'atns, which is a Sinya, Ph.
ornatus, which seems to be the young of Stentoda bipnnctaca, as also Pk.
festivus and minimus, which belong to the Drassoidoe, the remaining Theri-
dz'oidae forn] 0 perfectly natural group, which has accordingly been acknow—
ledged by OHLERr as a separate genuS, and by him characterized in a 50-
tisfactory manner. WESTRING 1105 however as early as 1851 (Forteckn. 010,
p. 46) reserved the name Plzrurolz‘tkus to the above named Drassoidoe which
KOCH had referred to this genus, 50 11101 OHLERTS Plzrurolitlzus requires a
new name. We have chosen the name Lithvyplzante& as indicating 1110 110-
11115 of the various 51100105 belonging 10 11115 genus. — By MENGE 1) Liclz.
corollatus 15 referred to his Ετιοῆανὶα, 1. 0. δέεαΐοῑῖα (SUND.) NOB.

In L. coronatus the superior tarsal claws are of about the same form
as those of 8100100111, 11111 somewhat stouter3 they are 1100111101οε1, with about
8—10 strong 100111 increasing rapidly in length from the base. The infe-
rior claw has a thick, blunt 100111, behind which 15 another fine and more

pointed. The female’s palpal claw 1105 0110111 4 000150 100111, pointing
forwards.

Gen. 16. LATHRODECTUS WALCK. 1805.
Deriv.: λάθρᾳ, secretly3 ὁήκτης, biting (δάκνω, bite).

Syn..- 1805. Lathrodectus [Latrodeotus] WALCK.‚ Tabl. d. Aran., p- 81-
1806. Theridium [Theridion] LATR.‚ Gen. Crust. et Ι115., Ι, p. 98 (ad partem).
1836. Meta C. Kocn, Die Aracha„ ΙΙΙ, (ad parm) p. 9, 10.
1864. Lathrodectus [Latrodeetus] S1M., H. N. d. A1·aignees‚ p. 177.

Type: Lathrodectns 13—5Juttatus (ROSSI).

This genus 15 50 nearly similar to Lithyplzames‚ 05 10 differ from it
almost only by a greater distance between the latera] eyes. If WALCKENAER'S
genus leerz'dium is preserved undivided, the species that compose Lachm-
dectus must unquestionably be affiliated to it, 05 11705 done by LATREILLE
and DUGES. —— The name ''Latrodectus'' is evidently formed of λάθρᾳ and
δήκτης, 111 1110 501110 manner as e. g. Lachrobium of λάθρᾳ and βιόω (10 11170),
and ought therefore 10 be written Lathrodectus. The derivation ”mzqom
merces, δεκτός, acceptus” given in AGASSIZ' Nomenclator Zool.‚ and that from
”λατρεὺς, ouvrier’' and δήκτης, which SIMON adopts, appear to me very im-
probable, as yielding no rational meaning for the name.
