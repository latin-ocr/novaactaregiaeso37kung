96 Τ. THORELL,

According to DUFOUR 1) the claws of his L. (Ther.) luyubffls — not
to be confounded with L. (Ther.) chfflzbris MOTSCHOULSKY 2) —- are destitute qf
teeth. XVALCKENAER says 3) that the inferior claw is toothless in the genus
Lathroclectns in general, and that in L. &pactatus all the claws on the
posterior legs are so.⁴ All these statements, as VAN HASSELT 4) suspected,
depend upon some niistake, probably on the claw—teeth in the specimens
examined having been broken off. In a L. Zuyubrz's (DUF.) from Spain Ι have
found all the claws evidently pectinated. The superior tarsal elaws are in this
species short and strong, regularly and pretty much bent, with (on the first
pair of legs) about 8 long, somewhat pointed comb-teeth, directed somewhat
forwards, the inferior claw is considerably smaller, with two short, blunt
teeth connected at the base, of which the foremost is much coarser but not
longer than the other. On the 4¹³¹ pair the teeth are not quite so many3 the
inferior claw there appears to me to show a rudiment of a third tooth (P).

Type: Euryopz'sflavo-maculata (C. KOCH).

KOOH himself, in the passage above referred to, has remarked, that
his stlicryplz. flavo-maculatus can hardly be suffered to remain within the ge-
nus Illicryphames. WESTRING, BLACKWALL ancl OHLERT accordingly detach
it therefrom: they reckon this spider as a Theridizmz. MENGE, on the other
hand, and, I think, With reason, has formed for it a distinct genus, Eurya-
pz's. To this genus he also assigns, though not without some doubt, Ther.
triste HAHN, which seems to be by no means so happy an arrangement.
We refer this species to Tlierz'dium sensu strictiori (Steawcla MENGE) ‚ although
