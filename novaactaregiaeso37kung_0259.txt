ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 97

it must be owned‚ that it deviates pretty considerably from the typica] spe-
cies of that genus. On the other hand Ther. loetum WESTR. and Ther. acu-
minatum LUCAS ¹) belong to Eva-mais, as Ι place the limits of that genus
(vid. p. 77). Of the last-named speeies, which was discovered by LUCAS
in Alyerz'cz, and which, as far as I am aware, has never yet been acknow-
ledged as belonging to the fauna of Europe, Ι found several specimus,
both Θῆ and ῼ, at Lz'vorozo (Leghorn) in the summer of 1853.

In E. flavo-maculata (ὅ) the superior tarsal claws (of the 1⁵¹ pair
of legs) are large, rather strong, but not broad towards their base, uni-
formly and almost semicircularly curved‚ with about 6 coarse, pointed comb-
teeth, issuing from the side of ‘the claw⁷ from its base to the vicinity of
its apex: their extremities form (together with that of the claw itself) an
almost straight line3 the inferior elaw is small, coarse, with two small and
very close-set, blunt teeth. The claw of the female's palpus is according
to OHLERT 2) strong, with 5 straight long teeth.

SUNDEVALL included this genus in his Drassides (Tabitelarz'oe Non),
among which analogous forms occur, e. g. the genus Ticaozoeca ΝΟΒ. among
the Amaurobiz'noe. By C. KOCH it was first euriously enough aggregated to
his ’'Ayelenides’⁷ (Uebers. d. Arachn.-Syst.‚ 1, p. 13), but afterwards rightly
to the ''The1·idides''. — WESTRING‚ BLACKWALL and others suffer it to re-
