main among the species of WALCKENAER’S wrm-idiunt —— Simon classes as
Asagyencc several spiders, which according to SUNDEVALL'S definition of this
genus can in no wisc belong to it.

The claws of the typical species are strong. The superior tarsal
claws are rather strongly curved, broader towards their base, pectinated, with
(on the 1⁵¹ pair of legs) about 10 long, straight, parallel teeth from the base
to near the extremity of the claW, which thus form a dense comb3 the inferior
claw has one very thick and blunt tooth and a fine point behind it. The
female’s strong, much curved palpus—claw is 111 the same manner as the su-
perior claws of the tarsus closely pectinated, with about 12 very long teeth
pointing somewhat forward.

I have not seen the species, on which Ι have founded this new ge-
nus, but the excellent description given by OAMBRIDGE (loc. cit.) leaves no
doubt of its differ-ing more from leeridz'mn sensu strict. than any of the spe-
cies that have been removed from that and referred to newer genera. (EAM—
BRIDGE says himself: ”The extreme dissimilarity in size between the two
''centre eyes of the front row, and the rest, and their position, is a striking
”characteristic of the species, and would almost warrant its separation from
”the genus Theridicn⁷⁷. According to CAMBRIDGE, the two centre eyes of
the front row are very minute, almost contiguous3 on each side of these is
a group of three almost contiguous eyes, in the form of an equilateral tri-
angle. The eyes of these two groups are dispropcrtionably large compared
with the size of the spider. The male has a projecting ridge round the
abdomen. ''By the position of the eyes this species seems to be allied to
''the genus Pholcus, though in general form and appearance it is much more
”like the true Theridia⁷⁷ (CAMBR.).
