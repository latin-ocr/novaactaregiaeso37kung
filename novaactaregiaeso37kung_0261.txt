ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERs. 99

into which we divide them, Pholcus Pluclzii (SCOP.) and Scytocles nmo—aeica
LATR, were referred by LATREILLE 18041)‚ together with the spidcrs, for
which WALCKENAER in the following year formed the genus Tlieridizmi, to
one and the same genus: Scytodes LATR, and even subsequently, after LA-
TREILLE had ackuowledged the genera Plzoleus and leericlizcm, which had
been formed by VVALCKENAER, he continued 2) to place Scytodes and Phol-
cus beside each other in his family Ianuiteloe. — WALCKENAER also at first
gave them the same systematic position: Scytocles and Plzolcus in his Tableau
d. Aran. (p. 79, 80) immediately follow Linyphz'a and ZI'lieridizmw but when
he began to make the number of the eyes a basis for his classification of
''les araignees'’ 3), he was obliged tc separate Scycodes and Plzolcus from
each other: Seytodes (together with Radius) is referred to a separate grcup,
'’CeZZulicoles'' 01· ”Οαρΐ611563”, which is placed between '¹ Tubieoles⁷' (Dysde-
roicloe) and ''Coureuses⁷' (Citiyradae) within the division '' Vayabondes⁷’‚ Whereas
Pliolcus (like Artemo) has a place in the group ’'Filiteleffi among ''Errantes'' 4).
Both genera were removed far from the ”Re‘citeles'⁷, which coi-respond to our
Theridioiclce. WALCKENAER seems however to have perceived that that me-
thod of classifying these spiders was quite artificial, for he himself says:
'’Le genre Scytode appartient encore plus particulierement aux lee‘2·idz'0ns
(i. e. than clo Dysclera and Seyestria to Clubiona and Teyeoiaria) . . . . et
le genre Rada est un Pholque dont les yeux intermediaires sont obliteres ” 5).

DUGES, who, like LATREILLE, acknowledged the close relationship
between Seytodes and Plzolcus, united these genera, together with Filistata,
Uroetea (Clotho), EnyO, Lac-lies (Lachesis) 6) and Hersilia into one family,
which he calls ''Seytliodes⁷⁷, also ''fllierofflzccthes⁷' ⁷), on account of these spiders'
mandibles, which are usually small and united at the base. These ge-
nera in fact show no small affinity with the Seytodoz‘dae, and this appears
to be especially the case with Enyo, Uroctea and Filistata. The Scytodoidae
agree with all these genera in having maxillae closely encircling the lip,
they particularly resemble Enyo (and Hersilia) in their fine extremities, with
the claw-joint of the tarsi distinctly separate; Uroctea in their mandibles
