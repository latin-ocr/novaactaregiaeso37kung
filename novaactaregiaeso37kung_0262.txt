Asayence several spiders, which according to SUNDEVALL'S definition of this
genus ean 111 110 wisc belong to it.

The elaws of the typical speeies are strong. The superior 161661
61111116 616 1611161 strongly curved, 111061161- towards 111611· 11666, pectinated, with
(on the Γ·1 pair of legs) about 10 long, straight, parallel teeth from the base
10 near 1116 extremity of 1116 616117, which thus form a dense eomb, the inferior
elaw 1166 0116 very thick and blunt 100111 and a fine point behind it. The
female’s strong, much eurved palpus-claw is in the same manner as the su-
perior claws of the tarsus closely pectinated‚ with about 12 very long teeth
pointing somewhat forward.

I have 1101 66611 1116 61166166, 011 which I have founded this new ge-
nus, but the excellent description given by CAMBRIDGE (loc. cit.) leaves no
doubt of its diffcring more from leerz'dz‘mn sensu strict. than any of the spe-
eies that have been removed from that and referred to newer genera. ΟΛΜ-
BRIDGE says himself: ”The extreme dissimilarity 111 size between the two
'’centre eyes of the front row, and the rest, and their position, is a striking
”characteristic of the species, and would almost warrant its separation from
”the genus Theridion⁷'. According 10 CAMBRIDGE, the two centre eyes of
the front row are very 1111111116, almost 6011110110116; 011 66611 side of these is
a group of three almost contiguous eyes, in the form of an cquilateral tri-
angle. The eyes of these two groups are disprepertionably large compared
with the size of the spidcr. The male has a 111-01661160 ridge round the
abdomen. ”By the position of the eyes this speeies seems to 116 allied to
''the genus Pholcus, though in general form and appearance it is much more
”like the true Theridia” (CAMBR).

As regards the proper place for the very peculiar spiders, that we
bring together under this name, opinions have been, and still are, very
,much divided. The types of the two sub-families, Plzolcz'noe and Scytodinoe‚
