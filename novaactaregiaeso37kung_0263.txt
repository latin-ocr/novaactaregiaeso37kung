into whieh we divide 1110111, I'lwlcns Pleu-hii (SCOP.) and Scytodcs thoracz'ca
LA‘rR., were referred by LATREILLE 15041), together with the spiders⁷ for
which XVALCKENAER in the foll‹.›wing year formed the genus lecridium, to
one and the same genus: Scjstodes LATR⁸7 and even subsequently, after LA-
TREILLE had aeknowledged the genera Plaolcus aud 'l'lzcrz'dz'um⁷ which had
been formed by XVALCKENAER, he continued ⁶²) to place Scystodes and Phol-
czcs beside each other in his family Inaquiteloe. — XVALCKENAER also at first
gave them the same systematic position: Scjstocles and Pholeos in his Tableau

each other: Scytocles (together with Raclws) 15 referred to a separate gmup,

«νοὶςῖαὴ 311(1 ''Comenses'’ ( &itast-adeo) within the division '' Ῑ’(1ῃ(ιῖ)οη[ἷε,ς”, whereas
Plzolcus (like Artenia) has 3 place in the group ’Tilades among '’Errantes'' 4).
Both genera were removed far from the '’Re'tz'tbles'⁷, which correspond to our
T lzerz'dz'oalw. &VALCKENAER seems however to have perceived that that me-
thod of classifying these spiders was quite 3111110131, for he himself says:
”Le genre Scytocle appartient encore plus particulierement aux Ἠιόνὶεῖίοηε
(i. e. than (10 Dysdera and Seyestrz'a to Clubiom and T esycum-ia) . . . . et

DUGES‚ who, like LATREILLE, acknowledged the close rclationship
between Scytodes and Ρῖιοῖεηε, united these genera⁷ together with Filisz‘ata,
Uroctea (Clotho), Enyo, Laches (Lachesis) 6) 311(1 Hersilia into one family,
