united towards the base, Filistata not only in this character, but also by
having the lip and sternum coalesced. The Pholez'noe at least are particularly
related to the leerz'dioidae in the construction of their webs: both WESTRING ¹)
and BLACKWALL ²) accordingly refer Pholeus to their slberidiidcw whereas
the Scytodz'noe show a certain relationship with the Dysderoz'dae (the nearest
relations to Filistata) in the form of the male’s organ of copulation, to which
may be added the identity in the number of eyes, which is probably what
principally induced BLACKWALL to place Seytodes in immediate juxtaposition
with that family 3). Even O. KOCH assigned Scytodes to the '’Dysdericles”4),
whereas he first 5) referred the Pholcz'me to his Drassz'cles, and when he had for
Pholczcs formed the family Pholcz'des G), he placed it next to the Drassz'des.
DOLESCHALL refers Pholcus to his Tubicoloe ⁷), which correspond most nearly
with our Ayalenoidce, to which family also AUSSERER ὃ), as well as CA-
NESTRINI and PAVE819) affiliate that genus —— for what reason, Ι am at a
loss to understand. Lowosceles is by LOWE referred to the Lateriyradce 1⁰).
The nearest relations of the Scytodoz'doe are however Fz‘listatoidae and Eny-
oz'dce (which last, on account of their elongated inferior spinners and free
lip, we consider ought to form a separate family), and especially the Theridz'oz'-
dee. That they, together with the two last named families, belong to the
sub-order Retitelarz'oe, is evidenced by their whole appearance, especially
their long, fine extremities, armed with three (in Lomosceles only, two) fine,
slender claws. The pattern on the abdomen is often bright and lively, and
depends in the Scytodoidae, as in the Retitelariae generally, on the pigment
of the skin itself, not on the usually thin coveriug of hair. As tolerably
constant distinguishiug features of this family we may also mention the slop-
ing, more or less projecting, long clypeus, and the presence of a spine or
tooth at the extremity of the mandible, opposite to the claw, indicating an
approach to the two-fingeret] mandibles of the opiliones 01· Plzalawyz'a. (Oonf.
