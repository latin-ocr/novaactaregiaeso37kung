102 T. THORELL,

In Ph. Pluchz'z' the superior tarsa] claws are large, weak, of equable
curvature, pectinated, with about 8 long, pointed, somewhat curved teeth
proceeding from the side of the claw, the inferior claw is tolerably large,
long and fine, bent to a hook, curved somewhat outwards at the extremity,
with 1 (25³) strong, pointed tooth bent inwards at the tip. The palpa] claw
in the female is rudimentary, and consists of a little conical, somewhat
curved process, surrounded by fine, pointed bristles, of which the two outer-
most are considerably stronger than the rest.

In the passage above referred to, DUGEs gave in 183ss a very scanty
description of a remarkable spider found in the south of France, which he
called Pholo-ns senoczclatus, but which differed froin other species of the ge-
nus Plzolcus by beiny destitute of both the centra eyes. This spider was also
found in Algeria. and excellently described and figured in 1847 1) by LU-
CAS, Who called it ‚Plzolcns quadri-pmzelatus. For this G-eyed spider WALc-
KENAER (loc. cit.) in 1847 formed a new genus, Raclms. But already in
1841 HENTZ had proposed the name Spermoplwra for an approximate form
(from Alabama), which name hc subsequently changed to Ooplzora (vid. Sym).
The female of that species, Spermoplzora meridionalis HENTZ, carries with
her the loosely conglutinated mass os eggs, holding it with her mandibles
(as is also the case with the species composing the genus Pholum), and
this is no doubt what has led HENTZ to give it the said generic names. HENTZ
himself says of Spermophora or Ooplzora: ”This sub-genus is very closely
related to Pholcus. Nay, had it 8 eyes instead of 6, and were its legs
much longer, it could not be separated from that sub-genus” 2). The whole
