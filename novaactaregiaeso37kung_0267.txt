appearance of the animal, 1116 position of the eyes and the structure of the
mandibles, are the same 111 Spcrmoplzom as in Radius, as may be seen by
a glauce at the figures given by LUCAS ¹), DUGI'sss ²²) and HENTZ ³). Only
the legs appear to be somewhat shorter in proportion in the American than
111 1116 European and North-African species. Even their industry and the
form of their webs are the same. Generically they cannot possibly be se-
parated⁷ and, as the name Spermophom 1166 1116 right of priority7 it must
be preferred to Raclms (and Ooplzora). -— In a paper that has lately ap-
peared 4), SIMON unites this genus with Plzolcns, 111 spite of the difference
iu 1116 number of eyes⁷ a proceeding which Ι 6611 by 110 11166116 approve.

This genus, 11111611, as we have above mentioned, originally included
also WALCKENAR’S Plzolcns and T herici-ium, was reduced by XVALCKENAER
106. cit. so as only to *comprise the species that typified the genus, S. tho-
racica LATR. WALCKENAER afterwards enlarged it again so, that according
10 1116 6116166161161166, it corresponded with the whole of our sub-family Scy-
todz'noe. We take it 111 1116 compass first assigned 10 11 by VVALCKENAER,
