claw3 the inferior claw is very small, and without teeth (in the next genus
it disappears altogether). The female’s palpi are destitute of a claw⁷ but
have instead three course brisdes, slightly curved towards the extremity‚ and
thickened Zilce α burton at tip, which internally disclose a canal terminating
in a blind, rounded enlargcment in the button. These bristles are surrounded
by numerous pointed bristles of the ordinary form. This all applies to S.
thoracica. In an exotic species (from Caffraria) I have counted 5 such—
like bristles dilated in the form of a button.

Type: Loxosceles citiyrada HEIN. et LOWE.

The genus Lomosceles7 which was formed by (HEINEKEN and) LOWE
in 1831 at the above mentioned place, is identical with ommam, proposed
by WALCKENAER in 1833 for Scytodes rufescens DUF. (loc. cit), though
VVALCKENAER himself afterwards united it with Scytodes‚ as a '⁷family’⁷ be-
longing to that genus. I however agree with SIMON in considering 0111031-
tes or Looeosceles as a group sufficiently characterized to deserve being pre-
served as an independent genus. In its appearance it bears a certain re-
semblance to some Plzz'loclronzinoe, and was therefore by LOWE considered
as belonging to the Lateriyradoe 1). The species of Lomoseeles, which I have
had the opportunity of examining, differ from all other Retitelam'oe, with
which I an] acquainted, in having only two claws 011 the tarsi. These
claws ‘are long and slender, strongly and regularly curved almost into a ⁷
semicircle. In an Egyptian species Ι have found them provided with about
12 very pointed comb-teeth, the points of which 110 111 an almost straight line;
in a specimen of L. rufescens (DUF.), from Spain, kindly sent to me by
Mr. SIMON‚ I have found only 8 such teeth. On the other pairs of legs the

Tclam praedae nec jacit nec ullam nisi fila quaedam struit”‚ says LOWE loc. cit. of
Looe. oitigyrczda.
