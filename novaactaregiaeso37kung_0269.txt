number of tecth is less. The female has no palpal elaw, but a little coni-
cal process instead. The claw-joint of the tarsi is shorter and slenderer
than in Scytodes and Phole-us.

Fam. III. ENYOIDAE.

The species of this little family have been generally placed in close
connexion with the following family, the Urocteoidoe, and have, together with
them⁷ sometimes been considered as Retitelarz'oe. and sometimes as Tubitela-
rista SUNDEVALL however included Enyo among his leeridides, while lie
united Uroccea with his Drassides ¹). Together with Uroctea, they were
referred to the Retitelarz'ce or Inaequz'telce by e. g. SAVIGNY and AUDOUIN 2),
SIMON 3) and O. KOCH 4), who however had at first ⁵) given both Enyo and
Uroctea a place among his Drassz'des; by LATREILLE 6), LUOAS ⁷) and others
both Enyo and Uroctea are placed among genera belonging to our Tubite-
Zarz’oe. WALCKENAER, who at first 8) referred these two genera to his ''Fi-
Zite‘les'', a group consisting exclusively of Retitelarz‘ae‚ afterwards 9) united all
the forms known to him of Enyoiclce and Urocteoz‘doe in the genus Clotho,
which subsequently took its place in the group ”mezades’' ¹⁰), which answers
nearest to our masmim,- but he soon 11) detached from it one of the three
families (''Uroctees⁷’‚ ''Enyo'' and '’Zodarions'')‚ into which he had divided
the genus, namely ”les Zodarions''‚ and aggregated it to the Theridioid genus
Aiyus (= Eriyom -1- Walek-enaera). Enyo and Uroctea were by DUGE812)
united with the Scytodoz‘doe and some others in his family ’'Scytlzode's'⁷ or
”illicrofflzathes’'‚ as we have already (p. 99) mentioned. SIMON forms for
them a separate ''tribus⁷'‚ ''Clotlze'z‘ens⁷’, of the family ⁷' ΤΙιιίνῑέἷῂΐονὶηεεΠ (100. cit).

Although the Enyoidae show a more or less striking resemblance
with almost every one of the various groups of spiders, to which they have
thus been referred, nevertheless they ought not in my opinion to be united
with any of them. Among the Tzcbz'telarz'oe it. is only the Umcteoicloe and
Elistatoz'doe‚ with which they can be shown to have any intimate connexion,
