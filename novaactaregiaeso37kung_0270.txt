106 T. THORELL,

and I think it is only the relationship, in which they have been placed to
the Urocteoidae, that has caused them to be foisted, as a sort of appendage
to these latter, into the sub-order Tubitelariae. The characteristic features
(the structure of the mandibles), which they have in common with the fizi-
statoidoe and Urocceoidae‚ belong equally to the Scytocloz'cloe. Their entire ap-
pearance, especially the long, fine extremities, indicate beyond all doubt
their place to be among the Retitelariae, and of these the Scytodoidce must
be considered as nearest akin to them. As in the Scytodoidae, the tarsus
is augmented with a little separate clam-joint, and even in the structure of
the mouth they seem to approach nearest to the Scytodoidae, though the
lip is separated by a suture from the sternum, as in the Theridioidae. With
the Urocteoz'dae, in spite of the considerable difference in their general
appearance, they show several striking points of contact, not only in the
similar position of the eyes, and in the mandibles being connected towards
the base and having a very small claw (as is also the case with most Sey-
todoz'dzc and Filz'statoz'dae), but even in the structure of the female's palpi,
Which are thickened towards the emtremz'ty, and ctrmecl with a powersul, pecti-
naced claw. The eyes are 8 in number, arranged in two transverse rows,
of which the posterior row is strongly curved forwards, so much so that the
eyes may also be said to form three rows.

But the Enyoidae differ from the Urocteoidae and all the Refitelariae,
and indeed, as far as I know, from all other spiders, in the structure of
their spinners. Seen in profile, these organs display a considerable resem-
blance to those of the Urocteoidae, for we first remark a pair of long spin-
ners, which appear to consist of a short basal joint, from which the remaining
part of the spinner issues in the form of a compressed longer joint, somewhat
tapering towards the extremity. But whereas in the Urocteoz‘doe the superior
(posterior) pair of spinners are the longest, in the Enyoz'dcc the inferior pair
are incomparably larger than the others. Moreover in the Enyoidae -— at
least in the species, Enyo gyroeca C. KOCH, which I have had the opportu-
nity Of examining — the hasal part of the inferior spinners is common to them
both.- seen from beneath it is almost inversely heart-shaped, rounded off in
front and cut transversely behind, with an incision in the edge, on both
sides of which the two real spinners are inserted. Thus seen, they lie in
tolerably close juxtaposition, are about as long as the hasal piece, but taken
together narrower than this, about double as long as broad at the base,
and tapering a little towards the extremity. The basal piece must be con-
sidered as a part of the abdomen, as it has not divides] itself into two se—
parate hasal joints for the spinners. The spinner itself is directed slightly
upward, as in Uroctea, and appears to consist of two j0ints, of which the
