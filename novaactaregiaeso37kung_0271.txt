ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 107

second is very short, and terminatos iu a flat surfaee, bearing the rather
few and very short spinning-tubes, which open each through a slightly
cnrved, cylindrieal spinning-bristle. —— As regards the superior aud inter-
mediary spinners, they are very small and difficult to observe. I believe
however that I have found them somewhat above the larger spinners, which
are situated at the extremity of the abdomen, in the shape of four pale
eylindrieal nipples, with a few spinning-tubes in their apices.

To this family we reckou two European genera, Zoelarivm and Enyo.
Of these genera, Zodarz'um corresponds to the ''R-aee Zodarz'onides'' of
WALCKENAER'S Aryus, Enyo to the ''Famille Enyffl of Clotho WALCK. By
SAVIGNY and AUDOUIN, G. KOCH, SIMON and others they are considered —
perhaps rightly — as eonstituting but one genus, Enyo. We distinguish
them in the following manner:

1. Series oculorum antieorum procurva .......... 1. Ζοᾱανὶωη.
2. Series oculorum anticorum sub-recta .......... 2. Enyo.

Among exotio genera, Laches NOB. (Lachesis SAV. et AUD.) and Sto-
rena WALCK. perhaps belong to the Enyoidae: the former genus has, ae-
eording to AUDOUIN ¹), the latter, according to CAMBRIDGE ²), the inferior
spinners longer than the superior, and three elaws on the tarsi.

In the ’'Description de l’Egypte’' loe. cit, under Genus Enyo, we find:
’'M. WALCKENAER vient d'etablir ce genre sous le nom de Zoelarz'on. Il
lui trouve plusieurs points de ressemblanee avec les theridions, et il le place
entre ceux—ci et les drasses.’⁷ It would seem from this, that the name Zo-
darium is older than Ewym AUDOUIN does not however indicate the source,
