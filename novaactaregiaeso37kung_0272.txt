108 T. THORELL,

from which he took his information, and 111 any work of WALCKENAER 111111-
lished previous to 1837, Ι have not found ''Zodarz'offl mentioned. As far
as Ι am awarc, WALCKENAER speaks for the first time of any spider of
this genus in his Hist. Nat. d. Ins. Apt.‚ Vol. 13 and he seems not to have
considered his ’'Zodario11s” or ''Zodarionides⁷' as forming a distinct genus
till in 1847. (Conf. Syn).

I have at Nizza met with a female specimen of a Zodarz‘um, which
seems to 116 identieal with Enyo praeca C. KOCH. Perhaps it is also the
same as E. Zonyz‘pes SAV. et AUD., and as E. occitanica DUGES; 11111 if such
be the case, the 51166165 must vary considerably in colour.

In Z. yrceczcvwz the free claw-joint is large and easily seen, much as
in Scycodes; the superior tarsal clavvs are weak, strongly curved, saw-toothed,
with about 6 large teeth proceeding from the outer side of the claw3 the
inferior claw is very small, without teeth. The female’s palpal claw is
strongly and uniformly curved‚ and from the base nearly to 1116 tip armed
with about 10 straight⁷ parallel, vertical 6011111-166111, 1116 11011115 of which
are situated in a slightly curved, nearly straight line: the tecth are accord-
ingly longest in the middle of the claw and shorter towards its extremity and
base. They are not inserted in the middle line of the claw, but 011» 0116 side.
The claw is surrounded by numerous hairy, pointed bristles.

Type: Enyo nitida SAV. et AUD.

I have 56611 110 51166165 of this genus. Enyo yermanica G. KOCH
(which is supposed by WALOKENAER to be the same as E. ‘nitida SAV. et
AUD.), and E. italica CANESTR. are the only European species of the genus
as yet known.

E. amammtlzz'na LUO.‚ which LUOAS only provisionally united with
Enyo 1), and for which XVALCKENAER formed the family ''les Incertaz'nes’'
of his genus Clotho 2), appears to differ in highly important features both
from Zodarz'um and Enyo, and ought in my opinion to 116 made the type
of a separate genus.
