The best way of briefly characterizing the Tubicelarz'ae is perhaps the
following: all known spiders, which cannot be classed under any of the other
sub-orders, belong to this! —- Their ordinary form and appearance are too well
known to need describing here; but within this polymorphous group we meet
with transition-forms to many different families, not only of Retitelarioe and
Territelarioe, but also of Latemfflwdae, Citiyradae and Saltiyradoe —indeed of
all the other sub-orders, except the Orbitelarioe. It is probably impossible
to mention any sure characteristic, that at once distinguishes these spiders
from all the other sub-orders, with which they are thus related: I have
therefore instead of this endeavoured, in the case of each of these latter,
to indicate such marks of distinction as appear to me decisive of the limits
between them and the Tubitelariae, and I refer to what is said on this sub-
ject under the heads of these sub-orders as well as under the different fa-
milies of the Tubitelariae.

The Tubitelarz'ae, as we already know, correspond to LATREILLE⁷S
Tecbz'telae, but certain of the genera included by us in this division have
been otherwise classified by other authors. Uroctea is often assigned to
the quoequiteloe or Retitelarz'oe‚ Filz‘stata again to the Territelarioe, Zora to
the Citiyradae, etc. To this we shall return in treating of the different fami-
lies. — The Tubitelariae seem, as we have also had occasion to observe‚
to be the lowest sub-order among spiders, that in fact, from which the
others have mediately or immediately been developed. It may be divided
into several families, which do not however all seem to be very sharply de-
fined. To the usually received three European families, Ayalenoz'dce, Drassoz'doe
and Dysderoidae, we add for the European fauna three more, Urocteoidae,
Hei-silioz'dae and Filistatoz'doe, which 6 families we characterize as follows:

I. Stigma tubi trachealis utrinque pone stigma sacci trachealis (pulmonalis) in
latere ventris non adest. Oculi saepissime 8.

A. Tarsi articulo unguifero aucti. Mamillae superiores reliquis multo longio-
res, articulis trinis aut binis: subtus tubulis textoriis praeditae. Series ocu-
lorum 8 amhae recurvae. Tarsorum ungues trini. . . . II. Her-silioz’doe.
