ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERs. 111

in Uroctea, along] the widersz'de of the elonfflzted 2”’ἰ joint provided with spz‘nozz'nff-
tubes, thcreby plainly showing the relationship of these spiders to the Hersi—
lioidoe and Anoalenoz'dte.

That they cannot however be united with either of these two fami-
lies, follows from certain pcculiaritics in their organisation. Thc cephalo-
thorax is short, reniform or inversely heart-shaped. The first joint of the
superior spinners is very short⁷ whereas the second is long, compo-essaei,
(md almost Zancetfornzed. lee anus is surromzcled by a double eroum qf a
peculim· kind of brz‘stles, which, as far as I am aware, has not been found
in any other spider‚ and whosc functions are unknown 1). Respecting the
different views⁷ that have previously to the present time been maintained on
the subject of the systematic position of 1110 Urocteoidae‚ we refer to what
has been stated above, p2 105.

Beside Urootea DUF. or Clotho (WALCK.), Ι include 111 11115 group only
the genus OEcobz'ns LUO. ²). That the ss-eyed genus Simo-ius WVALCK. (1720-
misoz'des Nm), which SIMON 3) refers to his '’Cloelie'z'ens’⁷, i. e. our Uroeteoz'doe
and Ewyoicloe, should belong 10 that group, seems to me highly improbable; I
imagine that it ought to 110 referred to the Thmfflsoidw, with which also
according 10 GAY aud NICOLET it is most nearly related 4).

Uroctea and OE'cobz'vs are easily distinguished in the following manner:

1. Oculi omnes rotundati, convexi. Cephalothorax sub-reniformis. Pedes ro-
busti. Mamillae superiores subtus tubulis tentoriis vestiti. . . 1. Uroctea.

2. Oculi intermedii postici sub-trianguli, deplanati. Cephalothorax inverse sub-
cordatus. Pedes graciliores. ............ 2. OEoobz'us.

Gen. 1. UROCTEA Dm. (1820).

1) DUFOUR, who did not succeed in observing any spinning-tubes on the spinners
of Uroctea, and accordingly supposed that these organs were not the true spinning
apparatus, believed that ”les veritables filieres’' were to be found between the cir-
cles of bristles, and that the bristles themselves ”servent de peigne ou de carde pour
enchevetrer les fils dont l'araignee fabrique sa demeure.'' (Descr. de cinq Arachn.
nouv., p. 200).
