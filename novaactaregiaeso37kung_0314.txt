Type: Uroctea Durandz'z' (WVALOK.)

Before this genus of spiders received the name of Clotho, that name
had already (in 1808) been appropriated by FAUJAS DE ST. FONDS to a
genus of shells (ε δακὶσαυα ΡΙ,ΕΗΒ.), and had therefore here to be replaced
by the more recent, synonymous denomination Uroctea, given by L. DUFOUR.
(Oonf. p. 9, note 2).

In U. Dzmmdii the tarsal claws are coarse, strongly curved, broad '
at the base, and have from the base to a little beyond the middle about ,
10—15 long stout comb-teeth, the points of which lie in an almost straight
line. The inferior claw is comparatively small, with one tolerably long
tooth near the base. The female’s palpal claw is very strong, curved almost
into a half-circle, with about 10 strong blunt teeth, gradually, but slightly in-
creasing in length when reckoned from the base, where they are very short.

The second joint of the superior spinners forms in this species (the
only one of the genus, with which Ι am acquainted) an angle with the short
basal joint, and is directed obliquely upward; it is of considerable length
and strongly compressed from the sides, almost lancet-formed, cnrved up-
wards and inwards, rounded at the extremity, without any traee of a se-
parate lamina there3 the spinning-tubes form a narrow, close band begin-
ning at the apex of the spinner and continued throughout the entire length
of its inferior surface, they are cylindrical, small, and very numerous. The
anterior or inferior spinners are short, with a plainly visible but short 2¹¹d joint.
The intermediate spinners are very small.

This genus was created by LUCAS loc. cit. for two small spiders

by him among the genera of spiders that have but sim eyes. SIMON, who
