has discovered both these species in Spain, and has thus enrichcd the Eu—
ropcan Fauna with this interesting genus, has had the kindness to send me
a specimen of each of them, whereby I have bccn enabled to observa, that
this genus, as well as Uroctea, has 8 eyes, and not only (ἰ, 35 LUCAS and
all others who mention it, have stated. The posterior centra] eyes, which
were supposed to 110 missing, have however quite a different appearance
from the rest. They are posited much nearer to the lateral eyes than to
each 011101, 311(1 are of 311 oblong triangular form, with the longest side

, turned towards the lateral eyes3 they diverge rapidly backwards with their
Ι, points, whereas the obliquely 0111 off base-sides diverge forwards. They

also show a more or less evideut transverse depression passing from the
Δ, {engest side to the opposite almost right angle. They are very 1131, and
erem· as glass, and very much resemble the similarly flat and 01031, oval⁷
or almost triangular posterior cent-ral eyes of certain Drassoidae (e. g. of the
genera Drassus and Gnaphosa).

’”’” The anus is surrounded by 3 double ring of 111151105, exactly as 111
1110 0350 of Uroctea. In OEc. annulipes the bristles of the outer ring are
curved almost in the form of 311 ω. Ι have not been able to discover any
[ow of spinning-tubes 011 1110 underside of the superior spinners. The legs
are finer and slenderer in proportion than those of Uroctea‚ especially in
OEc. clomestz'cus; but in fother respects the speeies of OEcobius are in the
highest degree similar to Uroctea. ancl SIMON very justly remarks: ”Un
observateur peu exerce prendrait les ecobes pour de tres-jeunes 01011105,
13111 l'aspect de tontes 005 araignees est semblable'' 1). 11 having been now
shown that the number of eyes is the same in both, the mutual agreement
between these two genera is still more striking.

ι The superior tarsal claws are slender, uniformly and much eurved:

in OEc. anmdipes I have found those of ‘the 1⁵¹³ pair 01 legs armed with
about 10 comb-teeth. not long, but increasing in length from the base. On
the 4²¹¹ pair the claws ,310 51111 111010 sleuder than on the 1St with about 8

applie's to OEc. ammlz'pes Q .

BLACKWALL 1135, under the name of OEcobz'us navus, described a spi-
der from 1113110113, which has 6 eyes, infra-mammillary organ and calamistrum,
2 claws 011 the tarsi, and three-jointed (?) spinners with spinning-tubes 011
1110 underside. None of these characteristics however belong to the genus
OEcobz‘us LUG.‚ and it is clear that the species described by BLACKWALL
