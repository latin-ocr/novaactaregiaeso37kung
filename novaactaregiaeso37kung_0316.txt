114 T. THORELL‚

does not even belong to the family before 115. BLACKWALL has proposed
a separate family for it, which he calls OEcobiz'dae 1), and which we also
have adopted3 but as it requires a new name, we call the family Omanoidae
and the species in question Omanuffi) mmm. (Conf. p. 44 above).

Fam. ΙΙ. HERSILIOlDAE.

The genus Hersilia, which was formed (1825—27) by SAVIGNY and ζῇ
AUDOUIN in ”Descr. d. l’Egypte” (T. XXII, p. 317 of the 2ud Edit), is1‚;.2‡f'
as the reader, from the few details above given (p. 109) under the head of ⁶·
the family Hersilioz'dce, is probably already aware, so peculiar, as scarcely “
to admit of being united with any of the other families that are referred to? ‚
the Tubitclariae. By SAVIGNY and AUDOUIN Hersilia was placed between
the genera Arachne (Nyssus WALCK.) and Erigyone. VVALCKENAER places
this genus between Ctemes and Sphaszw, and refers it to his ''Comenses''
or LATREILLES Cz'tz'yrczdce, on account of a certain similarity, in the position
of the eyes, to Dolomedes and Sphasus 3). It has the same systematic po-
sition in the works of LUCAS —— who nevertbeless has remarked that, in
his opinion, it belongs to another ’'semion'' or ought to form a new one 4) -—
as also in SIMON, who formed for it a ''tribus'', ''Herse‘lie-ns⁷' in the family
''Lycosiformes'⁷ 5). DUGES 6) reckoned Hersilia to his '’Mic-roynathes⁷⁷ or
⁷’Scythode's'’, SUNDEVALL ‘to his Drassicles, i. e. our Tzibitelarz‘oe ⁷), O. KOOH
to the family Apelenides among these S). It seems to me that the Hersili- ν’
oidae stand nearest to the Ayalenoidoe, with which they agree in the strue· ,ψ 1
ture of the spinning organs (especially in the spinning-tubes appearing not ἶ
only on the extremity but along the underside of the‘ superior spinners),
and the Urocteoidoe, whicli they also resemble in the structure of the parts
of the mouth: in that respect they also approximate to the other spiders *
