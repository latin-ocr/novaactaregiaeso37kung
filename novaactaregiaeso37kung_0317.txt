ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 115

distinguished by DUGES as ’'Mim·09natlzes⁷', accordingly to the Filistatoicloe,
Scytodoiiloe and Enyoidoe, of which the two last-named families have a se-
parate claw-joint on the legs, like the Hei-silioicloe. With the Citifflraclae this
family seems to me to be far less nearly related.

. Only one species of this remarkable family has, as far as I am
aware, as yet been met within Europe, viz. Hersilia oraniensis LUC., which
SIMON has found in Spain, and of which he had the kindness·to send me
a specimen (a young ff) under the name of ''Hersiliola oraniensis''. As this
species differs considerably from the typical species of the genus Hersilia,
we form for it a new genus, with the name proposed by SIMON, PIersiliola,
and we define it thus:

1. Tarsorum articulus unguiferus ipso tarso multo brevior. Mamillarum superio-
rum articuli bini: primus et secundus sub-aequales. Pedes δῶ paris reliquis
non valde breviores. .............. 1. Hersiliola.

Gen. 1. HERSILIOLA N.
ν Derim: Dimin. of Hersilia, histor. prop. name.

Type: Hersiliola oraniensz's (LUCAS).

In Hersilia caudata SAV. et AUD., the typical species for Hersilia,
the claw-joint of the tarsus is as loriy as the tarsus itself, the superior spin—
ners extraordinarily long, 3-j0inted, and the 3Γᾶ pair of legs in an unusual
degree shorter than the other legs3 even the armature of teeth on the claws
is quite different from that of Hersiliola oranieiisis ¹). LUCAS has himself
⁸ explained the properties that distinguish H. oraniensis from the other known
'species of Hersilia‚· he formed for it a separate division of that genus,
characterised by the shorter spinners and comparatively long 3¹⁴³ pair of
legs, but considered these characteristics as not of sufficient importance to
justify the formation of a new genus 2).

In Hersiliola oraniensis the superior spinners are about double as
long as the inferior, and consist of two cylindrical joints about twice as
