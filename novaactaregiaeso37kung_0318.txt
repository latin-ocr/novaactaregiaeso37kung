long as they are broad, and of about equal length, the second joint being
somewhat conically terminated. This second j0int on the undersicle exhibits
a row of (about 6) uuusually long and stout spinniug-tubes, about as long
as the medium diameter of the j0int, and terminating with a short, almost
cylindrical, truncated spinning-bristle. A similar large spinning-tube is si-
tuated just under the extremity of the first j0int. Moreover the end of that
joint and the whole underside of the 2¹¹d joint are occupied by a number
of sliorter and much finer spinning-tubes, which also terminate in a some-
what short, fine spinning-bristle. At the apex of the spinuer a few spinning³
tubes of different sizes are observable. The inferior spinuers are as thick ’ἰ
as the superior, but scarcely half as long, somewhat tapering3 their second
Joint is extremely short, the apex thickly covered with small spinning-tubes 1).

The intermediate spinners are somewhat shorter, aud of much less diameter ,ι

than the inferior, cylindrical, with a few spinuing-tubes at the apex.

The superior tarsal claws are rather weak, but large, of uniform ’-
curvature, with about 10 or 12 close-set comb-teeth, gradually increasing in
length towards the extremity of the claw3 the uttermost teeth are somewhat
sinuated (i. e. cui-ved a little in the form of an w) and divergent3 the in-
ferior claw is small, and has only one rather coarse aud somewhat curved
tooth. The claw-joint is plainly vi'sible, a little slenderer thau the tarsus,
rather longer than it is broad. Inside this j0int, in my specimen (a 0² jun.)
lies a new outfit of claws, ready to take the place of the old ones, which
fall away when the spider changes its integument. This circumstance I
have also noticed in younger specimens of species destitute of a separate “
claw-joint, e. g. in an Histopcma, and it would seem therefore to be a ge-
neral law, that previous to every moult new claws are formed within themr-
sus itself. OHLERTS] conjecture, that the old claws are retained, and only

their skin changed 2), is not reconcileable with these observations, and must α,

accordingly be considered as erroneous.

In Hersiliam offiniensis (and perhaps in other species of the same
family) it is a remarkable fact, that the palpas also of the male is armed
with a pectinated claw. This is at least the case in the 0² jun. of this spe-·
cies in my possession. Only one similar case was previously known, that
namely of Dolomedes fimbriatus, in which OHLERT has observed a pectinated
claw at the extremity of the male's as well as the female's palpus ³).

1) These tubes are cylindrieal, narrow, and apparently destitute of a spinning
bristle at the tip(‘?). ,
