The Agalenoidae were (letached as a separate family from LATREILLE'S

Tubz'teloe or SUNDEVALL’S Drassz'des by C. ΚΘΕ-Η 1837 (100. cit.)7 and that
family has since been acknowledged by BLACKWALL‚ OHLERT, and others.
In WALCKENAER it also forms a group⁷ ⁷'les Tapitbles’'‚ answering to one
.of our families. YVESTRING on the other hand preserves SUNDEVALL’S Dras-
‚sz‘des unffivided, and accordingly assigns the Ayalenoz'doe to that family. 81-

family, together with Linyplzz'a and others, into a ''tribus'’‚ ”les Liozjesplzz’efnffl
of the family' 'les The'uzclzfoimes'’ —— a way of classing them, which, in
&my opinion, is quite inadmissible. Species of the genera Dictyna and Τί-
⁴ taozoeca have 1”01“·,1]101117 before their relationship with Amamobz'us was detected‚
been ieckoned as leerz'clz'oz'dw, by e. g. WALCKENAER (who also has desciibed
a couple of speeies of Dictyiza under the head of his Dragmos), and SUN—
DEVALL, and even still by SIMON and OHLERT 1). Hyptz'otes on the con-
trary, which builds a regular, geometrical net in the form of a circular
sector, and is nearly related to Uloborus (vid. sup. p. 69 et seq), has been er-

„ roneously referred by AUSSERER 2) and CANESTR1N13) to the Ayalenoz'doe‚ to
which these authors, as well as DOLESCHALL4)‚ also assign Pholcus (and
Radius or Spermoplwra), which I believe to be equally unnatural. The
genus Texfflx, which exhibits sundi‘y remarkable analogies with the
Lycosoidae‚ has sometimes, e. g. by LUCAs 5), been placed in Juxtaposition
with genera belonging to this latter family, which 0150, through the me-
dium of Dolomedes, nearly approaches the Ayalenoz'dce. But it never-
theless appears to be generally admitted that the Drassoidae are the nearest
relations of this last-named family: the transition from the Assalenoz'dce to
the Drassoidae is in fact so gradual, that the demarcation can only be made
in a tolerably arbitrary and artificial manner-3 several genera, situated just
upon the boundary-line between the two families, have therefore been re-

⁷, feri-ed sometimes to the 0110, sometimes to the other, and sometimes they
have been formed into a separate family. Thus according to O. KOCH the
