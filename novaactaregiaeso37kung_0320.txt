species forming the genera Amaurobius and Coelotes belong to the Drassoz‘-
dee, to which also OHLERT refers the first-named of these genera, whereas
by BLACKWALL and L. Kocn Coelotes is assigned to the Ayalenoz'doe, and
Amaurobius (Cim‘flo BLACRW.) is made the type of a separate family, Cini-
flonz‘dae BLACKW. 01² Amaurobiiclce L. KOCH. These spiders are classified in
like manner by CANESTRINI and PAVESI 1). Ayroeca and Lz'ocrcmum, which
O. KOCH includes in his Ayelem‘des, belong according 10 L. KOCH to the
Drassoidoe. BLACKWALL refers the species of Ayroeca to the former, those
of Moeranum to the latter family3 and so forth — If attention be fixed ex-

related to Amaurobz'us than to the typical Agalenoidae, and Ι am therefore
obliged to conside1² the presence of the ..infra-mammillary organ and the ca-
lamistrum, which distinguishes the Amaurobiinae (but Which also occurs in
genera of the most widely differing families), as a feature of tolerably trifling
importance 3), and which barely allows the forming of a separate sub-family
for the genera of Agalenoidae, which are provided with these organs. As
regards the superior spinners, their length varies so considerably within ²
