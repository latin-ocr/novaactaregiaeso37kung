ΟΝ EUROPEAN spumis. 119

the limits of this family (compare, for example, Hadites teyenarz‘oides and
Teyenarz'a cinerea (cz'cnrea)), that it does not appear to me unjustifiable to
refer to it even genera, 111 which their 2¹¹¹l joint is so short, that it can only
have spinning-tubes quite at the artremity (Amam'obz‘inffl, Aoyyyroneta, Ayroe-
ca), or in which it has been reduced to a mere flat lamina bearing the
spinning-tubes‚ as appears to me to be the case 111 1116 genus Cgsboeus.
That the iuferior rai-sal clau) should sometimes be absent within a family,
111 which it is generally met with, is exemplified not only in the Dyscleroz'clse
and Scyzfodoz'doe (Looeosceles) but also 111 the Eresoz'doe (Papinianus), and I
therefore consider that I ought ‘to aggregate Agyroeca to the Agalenoidae and
not to the Drassoidae, although it has but two claws, for in its general ap-
pearance it seems to me to approximate much more nearly to the former
than to the latter.

It cannot however be denied that the family AgaIenoidae, as I have
understood its compass, comprises tolerably heterogeneous 61611161115, and I
therefore break up the European forms belonging to it into 3 sub-families,
Amaurobabzoe, Agyaleninoe and Aryyronetz'noe. C. KOCH also divided his ’'Age-
lenides'⁷ (nearly ansvvering to the two last-mentioned sub-families) into 3 such
groups: '’Eigentliche Trichter-spinnen'’, ”Wanderspinneff' and ''lVasserspin-
nen’⁷. The middlemost of these is au unnatural section, containing species,
” which ought to be distributed among the Ayalenoidae (: Plziloica O. KOCH)
and the Drassoz'clce (z Anyplzoeoza). — We distinguish the sub-families and
genera of the European fauna that belong to family Agalenoidae according
to the following scheme:
