122 T. Tironem,

in the family Ayalenoz'dce 1). That in the form and armature of the claws they
agree with the typioal Agalenoidae, has already been pointed out by OHLERT 2).
Even in the cases, when the inferior tarsal olaw has but two teeth (there are
usually more), these teeth are distinguished by their form: they are long,
eurved, generally very pointed, and the palpal olaw of the female is at the
same time armed with several powerful teeth. The spinning-tubes are very
small and short, sometimes, as in Didyma, diffieult to pereeive. »- The
European speeies known to me may be divided into five genera: Didyma,
Ανρθηηα, Titanoeca, Lethia and Amazcrobz'us.

It is BLACKWALL that we have to thank for having assigned to this
genus, which had usually before been reekoued among the Recitelarice, its
proper place in the vicinity of Amaurobius, and for having united With it

stigmata in the infra-mammillary organ, which MENGE here (loe. cit. p. 248) even
calls the tracheal area (”Luftroh1·enfeld‘’). Oonf. our note p. 30. But in other
species of Dictyna, D. arundinacea or beniyna for inst., the traoheae do not open in
the infra-mammillary organ, but just behind the rima genitalis, according to MENGE. —.
The ordinary air-saes are said (l. e.‚ p. 248) to be rudimentary in D. albo-maculata.
