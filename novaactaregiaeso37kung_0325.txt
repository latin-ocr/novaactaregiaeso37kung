those species of Drassus WALCK., which WALCKENAER referred to the ”5⁸⁵
fam, les Phytoplzz‘les” of that genus 1). It is however still by SIMON, ΟΗ-
LERT and MENGE referred to the leerz'dz'oz'dw, from which the appearance
of its claws is sufficient to distinguish it3 the inferior tarsal claw is in fact
armed with several (4-ss) long, curved teeth, which is never the case in
the sub-orders Orbitelarz'oe and Retitelarz'oe.

The spider for which we have formed this genus, and which we
have called A. lllenyei ²), seems to occupy an intermediate position between
Dictynna, Amaurobz’us and Hahnia, and 011 a hasty inspectior] reminds an
observer strongly of the last mentioned genus. I have but two dried spe-
cimens of it, a (φ and a ῼ (the first much 1113111611), which I found many
years ago here in the vieinity of Upsala. It is distinguished by the eyes of
the anterior νοω ὂεὶ119 situated very close toyetlzer‚ not more distant than are
the lateral eyes from each other. In the form of the maxillae and lip, as well
as in the unarmed legs, this spider is nearly related to Didyma, but the
form of the cephalothorax and the mandibles is much the same as in
Amaurobius.

The breadth of the large, arched, thin-haired pars cephalica is nearly
= ξ of the maximum breadth of the cephalothorax (in Ως it is somewhat
less in Οἳ). The eyes are of nearly equal magnitude, the anterior central
eyes a trifle smaller than the others. The anterior row of eyes 15 straight,
the posterior, when seen from before, cnrved downwards, when seen from
above, slightly curved forwards. The distance of the anterior series from
the border of the clypeus is a little greater than an eye’s diameter. The 4

central eyes describe a trapezoid broader behind3 the distance between the
