posterior central eyes is about an eye's diameter, and a little less than the
distance between them and the posterior latera] eyes. The eyes of the an-
terior row, like the lateral eyes, are so near each other as almost to be
contiguous. The mandibles are strong, and, seen from the side, almost
pear-formed; when seen from in front, slightly tapering at the extremity,
convex and somewhat projecting at the base, the length about double the
breadth. The maxillae are dilatcd at the base, sinuated a little inwards at
the extremity, and somewhat inclined towards the lip, which is large, al-
most triangular, and rounded at the apex. The last joint of the female's pal-
pus is cylindrical, not gradually tapering. Legs short, of almost equal length,
hairy, but without spines. The abdomen is short, inversely ovate3 the spin-
ners are tolerably far apart (almost as in C'ryplzoeccz): the superior somewhat
longer and thicker than the inferior, distinctly two-Jointed, with the second
joint slenderer and much shorter than the first. The superior tarsal claws
are much curved, with about 9 very long, parallel comb-teeth of about
equal length3 the inferior claw is small, with two long, fine, curved teeth.
The palpal claw has at least 3 teeth.

I have found it necessary to create this new genus for HAHN's The-
rz‘dz'zcm 4-92cttat2mn (= Amaurobius Kochz'z‘ AUSS.; Ther. obscurum WALCK.?),
which is widely different from both Thericlium and Lathrodectus. It has in
fact infra-mammillary organ and calamistrum, andis, in the form of the ce-
phalothorax, mandibles, and parallel maxillae, intimately related to the genus
Amanmbim. Even the position of the eyes is almost identically the same
as in that genus. In its broad, heart-formed sternum, in the absence of
spines on the (6 posterior) extremities, and in its colour, it much resembles
certain genera among the Theridioidoe, especially Asayena. The lateral
