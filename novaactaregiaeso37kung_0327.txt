ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 125

eyes are however still more distant than in that genus, which is probably
the reason why C. KOCH, after having first assigned it. to Α-ςαρωια, sub-
sequently transferred it Latlzarodectus. Δ

The anterior row of eyes is very slightly bcnt forward, almost straight.
The mandibles are a little thicker than the femora, perpendicular, their back
straight, only a little convex towards the base (iu Q). The maxillae are
almost double as long as the lip, parallel, without impression, slightly
rounded on the outside, straight 011 the inside, the apex rounded exteriorly.
The relative lengths of the legs is 1, 4, 2, 3. The calamistrum is re-
markably strongly developed: its bristles proceed from short, almost cylin-
drical nipples, directed obliqucly backwards, which form a row following
the superior border of the compressed metatarsus. The inferior spinners
are somewhat thicker and longer than the superior, two-jointed, with very
short 2’“1 joint. The palpa] claw is armed with about 10 strong, closely set
comb-teeth, pointing much forwards, and situated along almost the whole length
of the claw: the superior tarsa] claws, which are remarkably powerful, have
about 9 stout comb-teeth directed somewhat forwards, and their free extre-
mity is somewhat thickencd in the middle, the inferior claw is small, but
stout, with thor-ee pointed, curved teeth gradually increasing in length.

I have found several examples of this species at Kissingen in Ba-
varia, but only females and young males, under stones in dry chalky de-
clivities. In these the 1St pair of legs have hutone spine near the extremity
of the thighs: according to AUSSERER (loc. cit. p. 163) the adult 0² has 8 pairs
of short, knife-formed spines on the underside of the tibiae of the first pair
of legs, and the mandibles are excavated inwards and in front, as in Dic-
tyna, but less distinctly. The (3 other legs are without spines.

T. 4—9uttata appears then to stand about half-way between Dictyna
and Amamaobius, which latter it more resembles in its habits. Both AUSSE-
RER and L. KOCH 1) have already expressed the opinion, that it ought to
form an independent genus, distinct from Amaurobius.
