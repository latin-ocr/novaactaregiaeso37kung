Cimflo humilis BLAGKW. (Spid. of Gr. Brit, I, p. 145, Pl. IX⁷ fig.
2), of whioh speeies I have myself taken a female at Pyrmont in Germany,
and received English specimens from the Rev. Mr. OAMBRIDGE, differs too
much in the relative size and position of the eyes ete. from the genus
Amaurobius (O. KOCH) NOB. (Cimflo BLACKW. acl mam. pam), to be allowed to
remain in that genus. This spider has recently been described by MENGE
(loo. cit.) under the name of Lethia varia. — MENGE reokons Lethia to
his Therididae.

The superior tarsa] elavvs of L. humilis Q are rather stout, much
ourved, strongly pectinated, with (on the 1St pair of legs) about 8—10 long
straight, ooarse, parallel and very close-set teeth directed a little forvvard3
the inferior elavv has two very long, curved‚ pointed teeth and a very small
point behind them. The olavv of the palpus is tolerably weak, uniformly
and niueh eurved, and armed with about 4 rather long and pointed teeth
pointing forward aud gradually increasing in length.

Gen. 5. AMAUROBIUS (G. Kocn). 1837.
De1·iv.: ἄμαιιρόβιος, living in the dark (ἀμαυρός, dark3 βιόω, live).

Instead of the name given by O. KOOH to this genus, BLACKWALL
makes use of the newer name Cimflo BLACKW.‚ on the ground, that KOGH
has united under the name of Amaurobz'us species, that ean never be allowed
to remain together under the same generio name, nay‚ that in BLAOKWALL'S
opinion belong to quite different families ¹). That this reason cannot be ad-
mitted, is easily seen: one would thus for eonsisteney's sake be obliged to
eashier a great many good and universally acoredited generie names, e. g.
both Theridz'um and Drassus, because WALGKENAER referred to them spe-
eies, which belong to the genus Dic-cyna, and consequently to another fa-
