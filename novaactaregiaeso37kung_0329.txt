mily than either leerz'dium or Drassus. In these and similar cases it is
quite sufficient to detach from the old genus such species as one considers
not to belong to it, and to assign to them a new generic name, as also
BLACKWALL did, when he formed the genus Coelotes of species (letached
from C. KOCH’S Amaurobz'us.

In Amaurobius the claws are very nearly similar in form to those
of the typical Ayalenime, coarse and strong, with many and long comb-
teeth; on the inferior tarsal claw the teeth are sometimes 3, sometimes only
2 in number, but always long, pointed and curved.

Sub-fam. Π. AGALENINAE.

In this sub—family we combine the typical Agalenoidae, characterized
by having spinning-tubes distributed along the undersz'de of the superior
spinners 1), and also a couple of genera standing just on the points of transi-
tion, the one to the Drassoz'doe, and the other to the Amaurobiz‘noe, viz.
Ayroeca and Cybaezcs, We accordingly begin with the last named.

In C'. unqu-§tiaram L. ΚΟΟΗ, the female's palpal claw is slender, slightly
curved, with a long extremity, and armed towards the base with about 4
pointed, rather short comb-teeth pointing forwards. Of the tarsal claws
(of the 1st pair) the superior have about 9, ‘the inferior only 2 teeth. On
the 4³¹¹ pair the claws are longer and slenderer‚ with very long extremities, and
about 7 teeth, of which the outmost are rapidly divergent3 the teeth of the

1) BLACRWALL seems to be the first who (in 1833) observet] these spinning-tubes
and showed the erroneousness of the commonly received opinion, that theblong supe-
rior spinners in the Theraphosoidae and Agalenoidae were not spinning-organs‚ but a
sort of palpi (anal palpi, ''filieres tentacules⁷’). Vid. BLACKW., Spid. of Gr. Brit.7 I,
