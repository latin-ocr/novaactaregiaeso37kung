In a short notice of BLACKWALL's above cited work, ”The differenee
in the number of eyes with which Spiders are provided,⁷' eto, in the Pro-
eeedings of the Liun. Soc. for Apr. 21, 1840, we read as follows:

'’In the first tribe [Oetonoeuliui] he proposes three new genera, two
''of them belonging to a family, whieh he eharaeterizes under the name of
⁷' Cimflonidoe: these genera he also characterizes under the names of C'imflo,
”founded on Clubz'ona atroce of LATREILLE, and Operaria, comprising the
'⁷ T heridion beniynuvm WALCK., Drassus exiyzms BLACKW. and Drassus viridissi-
”mus WALOK. The third genus eharacterized by Mr. BLACKWALL, is referred
”by him to the family of Ayelem'dce, under the name of Cavator: it is founded
”on the Clubiona saxatilis BLACKW.'’

From this we may conclude that in BLACKWALL'S above-mentioned
paper, before it was printed, his genus Eryatz's, or Dictyna SUND.‚ was called
Operaria‚ and C‘oelotes‚ Cavawr. Although I certainly do not think that
an author has the right of arbitrarily changing a name, when it has once
been published, yet in this case Coelotes seems to me preferable to Cavator‚
and so much the more so, as 110 author of the notice that occurs in the
”Proceedings'⁷ is named, and the two denominations in question, there in-
