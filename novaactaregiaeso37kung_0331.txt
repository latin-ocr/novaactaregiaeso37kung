ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 129

troduced, are not used by BLACKWALL in the work in which they are said
to have been proposed, so that one has not even a right to cite BLACKWALL
as authority for them. It is best to consider them as ‘'nulles et non avenues’'.

As nia-y be scen from the synonyms, the species of Coelotes have
been referred to very different genera, and it was not till BLACKWALL had
shown that their spinning-organs are of exactly the same structure as those
of the typical Ayalenoz‘doe, that they received a secure position in the vi-
cinity of these spiders.

In the typioal speeies the palpal claw is strong, of tolerably uniform
curvatur-e, and armed with about 7 comb-teeth, gradually increasing in length,
and directed slightly forwards, the superior tarsal claws are long, strong,
and armed with about 13 similar long aud powerful teeth. The inferior
elaw has only two long, pointed, teeth.

Type: Teqenaria civilis WALCK.

The generic name Aranea was in 1804 restricted by LATREILLE to
the spiders now called Epeiw, but in 180ss he adopted for them this latter
name, which had been given them by WALCKENAER, and transferred the
denomination Aranea to those that he had before called Teyencw‘z'a. In this
signification it was adopted by several writers. But afterwards, especially
since SUNDEVALL ²) called attention to the fact, that the order of Spiders in
its entire extent ought to be called Araneoe, the use of this word as a ge-
neric name has gradually been abandoned.

l) In AGASSIZ’ Nomencl. Zool. it is derived from '’ Τέγεα, nom. prop.'' Snuou (and

also STAVELEY) thinks that it comes from ”τεγη, toit3 αιρω, elever'⁷.
