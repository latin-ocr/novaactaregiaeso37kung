130 T. THORELL,

We take the genus Teyenaria in the compass assigned to it by
WESTR1NG, i. e. we include in it also most of the forms, which C. KOCH
and SIMON refer to the genus or sub-genus Philaeca [Philoical. As how-
ever this last genus may at some future time be resnmed, it will not be
deemed superfluous to indicate here in a few words its relat-ion to Tessena-
ria properly so called, and to WESTRING'S genus Assroeca.

In consequence of C. KOCH⁷S contradictory and confusing definitions
of his Phasma, it is utterly impossible to determine, which species ought
properly to be united under that name, unless we accept the limitations
first given by him of Tegyenarz‘a and th‘loeca. XVhen these genera were first
separated (1837 , in Uebers. d. Arachn.-Syst., 1), KOCH cxpressly gave ’'Ara—
neus domesticus CLEROK⁷' as type of the genus Philam, and at the same
time set up as the type Of Teyenaria, ''Aranea domestica, LINN.⁷’, by Which
KOCH, as one sees from e. g. Die Aracha, VIII, p, 37, rightly understood
Te9e12aria civilis WALCK. But in 1850, in the 5¹¹¹ Number of Uebers. d.
Arachn.-Syst., this relation is reversed: there we find reckoned up under
the head of Teqenariat T. domestica (OLERCK), T. intricata„ T. campestois,
etc., whereas to Plziloeca are now referred T. civilis, T. affrica and near-
related species, as also two spiders belonging to totally different genera,
”Pa notata'’ (Liocranum domesticzmz (REUSS)) and ”Pla linotz'na⁷’ (Ayroeca
brmmea (BLACKW.)). In ’‘Die Arachniden’⁷ (vid. Vol. XVI, p. 49) KOOH reckons
to Philoeea only these two last-mentioned species, and a third, ”Ph„ acl-
vmza⁷', which appears to be a young specimen of Teyenaricc africa. If then
the genus Plzizoeca is to be retained as separate from Τεῃεηανία, which how-
ever to me appears superfluous, we are obliged by the law of priority so
to limit these genera, that T. domestica (OLEROK) may belong to Phaeaca,
and T. civilis to Tenqenaria, and not vice versa, as SIMoN has done (loc. cit).
For Phil. Zz'notina O. ΚΟΟΗ, which cannot be united with either of the above
genera, WESTRING has very properly formed a new genus, Ayroeca, and has
with so much greater reason given it a new appellation, as that the name
Philoeca is quite unreasonable for that species, which never lives in houses.

Of WALCKENAER'S Teyenaria (loe. cit.) the first two (sec Syn), and
possibly also the 3¹¹ family (⁷⁷les Brevilabes, Brevilabiffl) belong to Τερε-
ἠιινὶα ΝΟΒ.; the 4ωι fam., ''les Caudees, Candatae⁷', appears to agree with
the genus Histopona NOB. The 5¹¹¹, ”les Tissenses, Teoez‘rices’', answers to
SUNDEVALL'S and BLACKWALL’S Tamtrim.

The superior tarsal elaws are longand powerfnl, armed with nume-
rous comb-teeth, in T. atrica, for example, with 16--18 on the Γι and
