about 15 on the 4«. pair of legs. In this species the inferior tarsal elaw has
4 long, curved teet-h, and the sernale's palpal elaw about 10 teeth gradually
increasing in length. In other species the number of teeth on the superior
tarsal and ou the palpal elaw is soinewhat less.

Type: Cryphoeca silvicola (C. KOCH).

This genus I have thought it necessary to form for O. KOCH'S Hah-
πίει silvicola, which especially by the different arrangement of the spinners
essentially differs from the typical speeies of the genus Halmia. Even OH-
LERT ¹), although he refers it to Hahma (as cloes also MENGE in his Preuss.
Spina), thinks it ought preferably to form a separate genus. BLACKWALL
refers it to Teqenavm and unites the other speeies of KOOH⁷S Halmia with
Ayalena. It appears to differ from H'almzz'a also in the armature of the
palpa] elaw: whereas this olaw in Hahm‘a has no tooth or only one that is
scarcely visible, it has in Cryplzoeca silvicola 4 or 51011g‚ gradually increas-
ing teeth pointing slightly forwards. The superior tarsa] elaws have about
10 long, closely set comb-teeth; the inferior elaw has 3 (4 ‘?) long, eurved,
pointed teeth gradually inereasing in length.
