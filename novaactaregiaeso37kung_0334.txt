Type: Ηαῆηἰα montana (BLACKW.) (= H. pusilla C, KOCH).

The species belonging to this genus are referred by BLACKWALL to
Αῃαῐεηα, from which genus they are however easily distinguished by the
different position of the eyes. etc. —— On the superior, strongly curved tarsal
claws Ι have 111 the typical speeies counted about 8 long, powerful, close-
set, slightly divergent comb-teeth3 on the inferior 3: the female's palpa]
claw 15, according t0⁷OHLERr 1)7 toothless or provided with one scarcely
perceptible point below the middle. Also in H. eleyans (BLACKW.) (H. pratensis
C. KOCH') this claw is destitute of teeth, according to MENGE 2). — By MENGE
Hahnia (with Cryphoeea) is now referred to the family ΤΙιενὶιίὶἅω, from which
it seems to me to be widely separated.

Type: Ayalena labyrinthica (CLERCK).

BLACKWALL assigns to this genus much wider limits than we can
adopt, and even refers to it some species, to which the charaeteristics he
gives of Ayalena by 110 means correspond, and which we refer to siaonia,
Apostemcs and Ayroeca. Even his Ay. nyndmamzi is hardly au Αραῖεηα,
but still less does it belong to any of the three last-named genera. Also Ay.

row of eyes is straight and the central eyes of the posterior row are very

3) With respect to the animal’s rapid and restless motions. To derive this name,
as some have done (vid. e. g. Dict. Univ. (ΓΙ-1151. Nat. par D'ORBIGNY) from ἀγέλη,
hercl, has no other foundation than the accidental similitude of the letters in the
two words.
