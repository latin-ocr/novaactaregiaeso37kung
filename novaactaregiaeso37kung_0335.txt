disproportionately large, protruding and wide apart, their outer brims extend—
ing nearly to the entire length of the anterior row, according to CAMBR1DGE
loe. eit.

Of the two families into which VVALGEAENAER divided this genus, per-
haps the 2¹³³, '’les Nysses, Nyss<1³'', desei-ves to form a separate genus: Nys-
sns WALCK. 1805 ¹) = Arachne SAV. et AUD. ²). According to WALCKE-
NAER 3), λΙεῃαοηψηηεοὶηυι. [Alleycmzyomurlo-ion] REUSS 4) or Dyctz'on WALCK. ⁵)
is identieal with Arachne SAV. et AUD.

The derivation of the name given above, is that generally adopted,
and the only one whieh affords a ratione] meaning to it. I therefore write
Agyalencz, not Ayelena, as is usually the eustom. It is an additional reason
for writing Ayalena, that WALCKENAER himself, when he used that word as
a speeifio name (in ''Epeira ayalenffl) always wrote it thus.

The long, powerful, superior tarsal elaws, in the typieal speeies,
have 10 or 12 eomb-teeth, the inferior 3 or 4 long, ourved, pointed teeth.
On the palpa] elaw, which is more slender, I have eounted 6 166111 rapidly
inereasing 111 length, and pointing more forwards. The superior tar-sal elaws
of the 4¹¹¹ pair have about 14 teeth.

The spider we have ohosen as type for this genus has, as we see,
been referred by C. KOCH first to Αραίεηα, 111611 10 quenarz'ffi and lastly
to Textrioe. To me it appears 10 stand about midway between the two last
