and that the eyes⁷ of which the posterior lateral ones are almost of equal
size with the central7 are, when seen from before, arranged in two 'rows
uniformly and slightly curved forwards3 the posterior row, seen from above,
is just a little bent backwards. In another, apparently uudescribed spec-ies
from Nizza, the anterior row is straight, or, if bent, bent rather backward
thau forward; the posterior row, seen from above, is scarcely perceptibly

curvet] backwards, and the second joint of the superior spinners is longer

than the first. This genus differs from 'l‘eyenarz'a chiefly in the greatly
elongated superior spinners, which are cxactly like those of Teoetrtv. O.
KOCH⁷S T eretria} montana ¹) belongs beyond a doubt to Histopona, as do
probably also the spiders, which WALCKENAER refers to the 4⁶¹¹ Fam. ”les

In H. torpida the claws are of the form usual in the Agaleninae‚
powerful‚ pretty much curved⁷ with a long, strong extremity, and about 10
somewhat diverging teeth‚ of which those at the base are much the smallest3
the inferior claw has 3 teeth, of which the inmost is very small. The fe-
male’s palpal claw is slender, pretty much cuwed, with about 7 gradually
inereasing, sharp teeth pointing forwards. In the above mentioned species
from Nizza the superior tarsal claws are very closely pectinated, with about
14-17 teeth3 the inferior claw has 3.
