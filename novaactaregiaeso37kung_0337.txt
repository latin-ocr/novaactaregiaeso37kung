As regards our limitation of this genus, we refer to what has been
said of 1116- preceding genus, or Histopona. —— The superior tarsal claws
in T. denticulata 01 lytcosz'na arc of 1116 form usual in the family, but not
particularly strong, pretty regularly curved, with about 10-—12 comb-teeth
gradually increasing in length, the outermost pointing forwards and diverging.
The inferior tarsal claw has only two tecth. In a few other species (among
which is Τ. vestita. or ferrugfl'nea C. KOCH) I have also found only 2 teeth
on that claw.

Type: Hodites Teyemwiozkles KEYSERL.

Of this remarkable, blind spider, which has hitherto been found only
in the subterraneous caverns of the isle of Lesina, Count KEYSERLING has
kindly presented me with a female specimen. —- The superior spinners are
very long, two-jointed: the first joint is more than double as long as it is
broad, and somewhat longer than the inferior, thicker spinners, the 211ιῖ joint
is not 50 thick as the first, but equally long, conically pointed at 1116 ex-
tremity, covered 011 the underside with very long spinning-tubes3 on the
apex of the ι101111 a similar, very coarse spinning-tube is situated. Such a
tube is found also at the apex of the slender intermediate 5111611615- The
palpal claw is weak, pretty regularly and slightly curved, with about 8—
10 gradually increasing, pointed comb-teeth directed forwards, The tarsa]
claws are of the form usual in the Αραῖεηὶηῑε, somewhat weak, with about
12 long, pointed comb—teeth directed forwards, the inferior claw is small,
with 3 long, pointed 166111. —— KEYSERLING has found only 7 01· 8 166111 011
the superior and 2 on the inferior tarsal claw (loc. cit., p. ὃ).
