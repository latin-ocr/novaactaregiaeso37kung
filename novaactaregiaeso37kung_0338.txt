Concerning Philoeca O. KOCH v. p. 129: Gren. 7. Teyenarz‘a. — The species of
this genus are referred by BLACKWALL and OAMBRIDGE to flymena, from
which they differ widely by the totally dissimilar structure of the spinners ete.—
In A. brunum the female's palpal claw is moderately curved, with 5 toler-
ably long comb-teeth gradually increasing in length, and pointing somewhat
forward. The two tarsal elaws on the 1st pair of legs are pretty powersul,
with about 4—ss strong comb-teeth3 on the 4³¹ pair they are thiu and slender,
much weaker and longer than those of the 1⁵t pair, springing at a right
or slightly acute angle from a narrow, high basement, and armed with about
5 or 6 sparse teeth gradually increasing in length and pointing somewhat
forwards. Thus the form of the claws on that pair differs from that which
is usual among the Agalenoidae, and indicates that Alqroeca stands just upon
the point of transition to the Drassoidoe. As in these latter, the tarsi have
no inferior claw. The inferior spinners are a trifle longer and thicker than
the snperior; their 2¹¹³ joint is very short, scarcely perceptible, with rather
few„ short spinning-tubes at the apex.

Sub-fam. ΠΙ. ARGYRONETINAE.

Aryyroneta aquatica seems to me to deserve to be¹ taken as the type
of a separate sub-family, as well on account of its peculiar habitS, as of the
structure of its respiratory organs. Aryyroneta has in fact, as has been
shown by GRUBE 1) and MENGE ²), two large tracheal tubes opening close
to each other in a transversal groove, situated a little behind the ordinary
genital- or ”pulmonary⁷' groove, in which the two tracheal sacs have their
stigmata. These large air-tubes run through the petiolum into the ce-
phalotliorax, there sending out bundles of fine tracheae into the legs, palpi
and mandibles ete: near the stigmata they give off two such bundles for
the abdomen 3). In certain species of Didyma, D. arundinacea for instance,
