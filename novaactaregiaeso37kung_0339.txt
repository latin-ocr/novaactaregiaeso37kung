the traeheae have a similar distribution 1). Also in Anyphoena (of the family
Drassoz'dcv), L. KOCH ²) has discovered a transversat groove under the ab-
domen, into which traeheae probably debouch. With respect to the position
of its stigmata, Ammonem (as also Dictyna arundinacea ete.) is related to
the Dysderoz'doe‚ which have also 4 stigmata, of which two lead to traeheal
tubes: but these stigmata lie, each behind the corresponding one of the
stigmata of the tracheal saes, at the sides of the abdomen, whereas in Ar-
yywneta (and Dictyna) the two tracheal tubes terminate near the middle-
line of the belly.

Type: Arqyroneta aquatica (CLERCK).

In this spider the superior tarsal claws are large and powerful, al-
most straight at the base, afterwards eurved strongly and much downwards,
with (on the 1st pair of legs) about 9—12 long, vertieal, parallel comb-
teeth‚ of which the 2 or 3 innermost are much smaller than the others.
The inferior elaw has 3—4 pointed teeth gradually increasing in length.
On the remaining pairs of legs the number of teeth on the superior elaws
is somewhat less. The first half of the palpal claw shows about 6 some-
what diverging teeth, of which the innermost is much smaller than the rest.
