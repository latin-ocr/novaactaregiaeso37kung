marked pars cephalica, and whose 2¹¹d pair of legs is not longer than the
others —— I have adopted the limitations of the genera given by L. KOCH
in his excellent work: Die Araclmiden-familie der Drassiden. As aforesaid
however, Ι exclude from this family Affloeca, which in my opinion ought
to be classed among the Aqalenoz‘doe, although it has not, like the other
genera of that family, three, but only two claws at the extremity of the
tarsus, as also Storena (Oonf. p. 107). Αῇοετεηηε 15 1101 received as a se-
parate genus in L. KOCH⁷S work, neither is Thym adduced in it, this last
genus having been later made known to arachnologists.

The want of a distinctly marked pars cephalica, together with the
presence of only 2 tarsal claws, distinguishes in doubtful cases the spiders
belonging to this family from the Agalenoidae, into which they gradually
pass, through e. g. Apostenus in the one family and Ayroeca in the other.
From eertain not distinctly laterigrade leomisoidw (illisumeaem), the Dras-
soidae are easily distinguished by the relative length of the legs: the 2¹stl
pair being not longer than the others. All European Drassoidae have 8 eyes,
except Thym, which has but (3. As their eyes, of which the two centra]
ones of the anterior row are never considerably larger than the rest, are,
exeepting 111 Ζονα, arranged in two transverse rows, they are thus easily
distinguished from the Attoz'dae. From certain other (exotio) Salcz'qradoe
(Otiothops‚ lllyrmecz'wn 510), which approach near the Drassoidae in the
position of the eyes, the Drassoidae are probably best distinguished by
their cephalothorax being less high and broad anteriorly. Zora in the po-
sition of the eyes approaches the Lgscosoiclce, but not only the number and
form of the elaws, but also the double row of long, moveable spines under
the tibiae and metatarsi of the anterior legs, indicate for that spider a place
in the vicinity of Apostenus among the Drassoidae.

The structure of the tarsal elaws is very various. While in the Agm-
leuoidae they are gradually tapering, more equably curved, they 515 generally
in the Drassoidoe of a more uniform breadth and straight at the base, and bent
downwards only towards the extremity. Yet the genera, that in other re-
speets approach the Agalenoidae, as Lioerannnz, also have claws more like
1115115 111511 111055 of the typical Drassoidae. Even among these we find that
large and strong species, e. g. Drassus J-pmzctm‘us, Gnaplzosa lueg'fuya, have
claws gradually tapering from the base. The elaw-teeth are in general less
numerous and 51011151· 111511 111055 of the Agalenoidae. In the genera, which,
at least in the structure of the elaws, form the transition to the Paomisoidae
(mationa, Chii-acantlzz'um), these organs are very elongated and closely pec-
tinated with many 155111, The 11511151 claw is often entirely ‘roothless3 fre-
quently it has a few, rarely many 155111.
