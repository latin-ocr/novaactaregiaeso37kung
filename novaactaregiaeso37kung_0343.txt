The name Lssscoc‘lz'a SUND. (Consp. Arachn.) 15 cithera slip of the pen
or a misprint for Lycaeum, as is evident partly from the passage cited in the
Consp. Araehn: ''Lycodirz Act. Holm. 1832’‘ — in Act. Holm. (Vet.-Akad.
Handl.) 1832 the word is Lycoena, not Lycodia -- partly from SUNDEVALIJS
own express declaration in '’Jxrsber. om nyarc zool. arb. o. uppt. mest—40⁷2
p. 340. It is on this account that the name Zom is to 110 preferred 1ο
Lycodz'a. The names Lycwom and Hecae'oyce were already applied 10 genera
of butterflies before they were given to the spiders now under considera-
tion 2). Conf. WESIRING, Aran. Suec.. p. 325.
