142 T. THoRELL‚

This genus, which is not received by L. KOCH in his ”Die Arachn-
fam. d. Drassiden’⁷⁷ appears to me to form a transition from the Drassoidae‚
011 the one side to the Agyalenoz'doe, and on the other through Zora to the
Lycosoicloe. By BLACKWALL a couple of species belonging, as far as Ι 6311
566, to this genus, are referred to Ayalewa, namely his A. celans and yra-
cz'lz'pes 1). —— A. fuscus WESTR. Ι have found at Kissingen in Bavafla, and af-
terwards also at Sederkoping in Sweden3 another species is described by
AUSSERER 2) under the name of A. samaritis.

The tarsal olaws of A. fuscus are weak⁷ n1ucl10u1·ved‚and provided
nearer the base with 4—5 divergent, rather long comb-teeth gradually in-
creasing in length. On a 60111631 process beneatli them are only two, 60-
105531 hairs (the claw-tuft)‚ in the form of fiat thin slices, narrow at the
base, gradually (11131611, and cut off obliqucly at the broad extremity. They
are much longer 111311 1116 claws. The palpal claw, which is weak like
those of the tarsi, has 2 or 3 teeth pointing forward, near its base.

To Apostenus or some nearly related genus belongs perhaps Aranea
spinicrus DUF. 3), which however is by WALOKENAER referred to the genus
Sparassus 01· stlicrommala 4), 35 also Drassus sub-niqer CAMBR. 106. eit.

Τ1115 South-European genus is known to me only by the few words
with which it is characterized by L. KOCH in the above cited passage. I am
not even sure that I have assigned it a right place in my schema, for L.
KOCH does not say that the posterior row of eyes, seen from above, is
curved baekwards, but only: ”die hintere Angenreihe durch Tieferstehen der
Mittelaugen gebogen.⁷’ CANESTRINI and PAVEsl ⁵) refer Trachelas to the The-
ridz'oz'dOE, not to the L'rassoz‘dae.
