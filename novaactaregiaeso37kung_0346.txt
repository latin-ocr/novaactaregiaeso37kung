gether with this or the typical 81166168, also C‘Zubz'ona nutrioe WALCK.‚ which
116 however some time afterwards detached from Anyphoena and united with
a couple of other species into a new genus, Chiracanthium. To take, as
SIMON has done, the generie name 01 Anyphoena for just these species, which
SUNDEVALL never referred to that genUS, is of course an error.

L. KOCH has discovered (vid. 106. cit, p. 194) that Anyphoena is
distinguished by both sexes having 011 1116 underside of the abdomen, some-
times in the middle of the belly, sometimes a little fore or aft of that point,
a small transversal groove or sold of the skin. I imagine that in this groove
there are one 01· 11νο tracheal stigmata, as is the case with e. gr. [419910-
neta aquatica, which has a similar groove under the anterior part of the
belly. (Vid. sup. p. 136).

The tarsal elaws of A. accentuata are rather small, strong, with
about 14—20 long, closely set comb-teeth on the inner olaw and only about
half that number 011 1116 011161. The claw-tuft is formed of uncommonly
broad, flattened, platelike hairs, which are dilated outwards, cut almost
transversely at the extremity, and somewhat longer than the olaw.

1) The usually received etymology, κλέος, fame, βιόω, live, seems highly im-
probable. — Perhaps the name is formed of κλωβίον, a bird-trap (with reference to
the sack-like tube which these spiders inhabit).
