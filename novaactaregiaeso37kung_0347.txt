about double as many on the interior as on the exterior elaw. The chief
part of the elaw forms almost a right angle with its base. The elaw-tuft
varies great1y3 in the larger speeies it is strongly developed, especially on
the 4⁰¹ pair of legs, where the hairs are long and thin and more numerous
than 011 the 1St pair, aud almost similar to the tuft-hairs of Chiracauthium.
The elaws themselves are also 011 that pair considerably longer than on the
1st pair. The palpa] elaw is small and without teeth.

The tarsal elaws are of the same form as among the Philodrominae
in the next sub-order: they are small, long⁷ slender⁷ almost straight, except
at the extremity, where they are bent into a hook. They spring at a right
angle from a slender, high base: the inner elaw has on the underside about
15 eoarse‚ short, vertieal, conical, somewhat sparse eomb-teeth‚ that gra-
dually increase 111 length3 on the outer elaw the number of teeth is some-
what less. The elaw-brush is very thick and longer than the elaw itself3
its hairs are long and slender‚ slightly broader Just at the extremity (as in
Micrommam). The palpa] elaw is toothless, as in Clubz'mza:
