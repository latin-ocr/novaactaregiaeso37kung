ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 147

The tarsa] elaws are small, straight at the base, but towards the
extremity curved almost 10 a semieirele, with few teeth. In M. pulle-aria
the teeth are only 2 in number, very short and blunt3 in M. fnlgye'ns they
are 3, longer, but sparse, thick, and very obtuse. The hairs of the elaw-
tuft are few, dilated, rounded at the extremity3 the whole underside of the
tarsus is ‘thinly covered with suthike hairs.

Under this genus SIMON ¹) takes np as synonyms Corinna O. KOCH ²)
and Drassz'na GRUBE³)‚ both of whieh appear 10 me to be very remote
from it. Drassma. is stated to have three elaws on the tarsi, and, if this
be really so, eannot even belong to the family Drassoidae. Corinna would
seem to stand on the point of transition from the family Drassoz'dae to the
Mymnecioidoe, to whieh last the genus is referred by C. KOCH: to me
it appears rather to belong 10 1116 former family. L. KOCH however has
not received it among the Drassoidae.

In common with L. ΚΟΟΗ, we unite XVESTRING’S Drassocles with his
Dimissus in one genus, 511166, as L. KOCH has shown, 11 15 not at present
possible to determine any sure line of separation between them, however
different 111 their general appearance the more typieal speeies of 111656 two
groups may be. It must 1101 however be forgotten, that ‘the form of the
cocoons 111 WESTRING⁷S Drasszcs and Drassocles is quite different, although of
course that eireumstanee alone cannot be considered as possessing any de-
