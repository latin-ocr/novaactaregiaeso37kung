cisive importance. — In BLACKWALL the genus Drassus has a far wider
compass, and comprises also the groups Phrurolz'thus, Micaria, llIeZanophora
and Gnaphosm which we have considered as separate and independent ge-
nera. WALCKENAER‚ as is well known, also referred to this genus many
other and widely separate forms, among which are some speeies of the
genera Coelotes and Didyma, to which BLACKWALL first assigned their true
places in the system. *

The genus Ilerpyllus HENTZ seems very nearly to eorrespond to
Drassus WALCK., and comprises not only species of the genus now before
us, and of Gnaphosa, but probably also of several others, silicem-ia and
Melanophora among the rest. Conf. HENTZ, Aran. of the United states,
in Boston Journ. of Nat. Hist.7 V⁷ p. 454—461, Pl. XXIV, fig. 2—20.

In the genus Drassus the tarsa] elaws are powerful‚ straight at the
base⁷ generally somewhat long, especially on the posterior legs, armed
below with 5 or 6 strong eoinb-teeth3 the palpa] claw has about 3 teeth
at some distance apart. Such is the case with e. g. D. lapidicola. In D.
quadri-pzmctatus the claws are still more powerful⁷ but in other respects
very similar. The hairs of the claw-tufts are in general dilated towards
the extremity, flastened, and mostly short; they are often continued on
the tarsus throughout its underside, especially on the first pair of legs. In D.
braccatus (vid. infra) I have eounted 3 thick, almost parallel comb-teeth and a
little point before them on the tarsal claws, 2 or 3 teeth on the palpal claws.

In the vicinity of Sederkoping I have met with a particularly fine
species Of Drassus ¹) (no doubt identical With D. braccatus L. KOCH‚ though
the cephalothorax in that species is said to be black‚ whereas in my spe-
cimens it is reddish brown), which in some respects appears to form the
transition to Gnaplzosa. In size and colour it is very like Gn. varicma,
but the position of the eyes is exactly the same as in Drassus. The po—
sterior edge of the claw-furrow of the mandibles forms in this species with
the corresponding longitudinal in'ner edge of the mandible a strony, riqlzt-
