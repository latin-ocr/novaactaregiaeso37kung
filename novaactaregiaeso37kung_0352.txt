150 T. THORELL,

This genus, for which LA'rREILLE in his Genera Crust. et Ins. (I,
p. 125) still uses the name Gnaplzosa — a name which he afterwards
changed for the more recent Walckenaerian denomination Drassus — has
in LATREILLE for its type Gwaplzosa melanoyaster LATR. (Aa-anea Zucz'fnya
WALCK. 1802), ancl it answers, in the more restricted meaning in-which
we now, in right of priority, restore it to seience, the genus Pythonissa
C. KOCH, for which without doubt the sanie speeies is typical. As regards
the more accurate determination ot the limits of Gnaplzosa or Pythonissa,
we follow L. KOCH, and accordingly refer to this genus P. variana O. KOCH,
which, as well by the position of the eyes, as by the presence of the little
lamina, into which the posterior edge of the mandible's claw-furrow is drawn
out, shows itself to belong to this genus and not to lllelanoplzora, to which
WESTRING refers it. The eocoon of this spatenis however of an altogether
different form from that of the other speeies both of Gozaphosa and Asela-
owpltora known to me: it is not plano-convex and of a firmer substance, re-
sembling paper, but loose and lenticular, as in e. g. Drasszcs lapidicola. We
also consider Pyth. maculam C. KOCH (Ar. nocturna LINN.) as a Gnaplzosa,
though standing on the limit between that genus and MeZawoplzqra, to which
WESTRING refers it. The elaws in this spider are very dissimilar to those
of the other species both of Gnaplzosa and rllelcmophorcz, which I have
examined.

The tarsal elaws are in Gnaplzosa usually small, but coarse and
powerful, of about the same form as those of Drassus: of nniform breadth
or slightly tapering and straight nearest to the base, much bent towards
the extremity, which is long and strong. On the nndcrside they have only
a few eomb-teeth (in G. Zercz'fu‘qa e. g. about 5—45). On the 42¹¹ pair the
elaws are weaker and more uniformly curved. The palpal claw is tolerably
strong, with some few (in G. Zzwz'fuya about 5) eoarse comb-teeth. Devia-
tions fron] this however occur: 111 G. marnam for example, the tarsal elaws
ot which have 5-7 rather long and close-set eomb-teeth, the palpal claw is
long and slender, slightly and uniformly curved, with about 15 fine, long,
very closely set conib—teeth. G. nocturna deviates still more: in this spe-
eies the palpal claw is toothless; the tarsal elaws are weaker, inore equably
curved, and armed from the base nearly to the extremity with about 5 or
(3 conieal teeth, proceeding from the side of the claw, the free extremity
of the claw is very short.

Remarlcs. LATREILLE is the first, who, after VVALCKENAER had in
1802, in liis Faune Parisienne, separated Mygmle from the great Linnean
genus Aranea, divided the remaining spiders into several smaller groups
