which were retained by WALCKENAER in his Tableau des Araneides (1805).
As to the groups which received new names from WALCKENAER, LATREILLE

The remarkable spider, for which this genus has been formed, and
of which only one specimen, a female, has been found (at Erlau in Hun-
gary), is known to me only through KEMPELEN'S description and figures (loc.
eit). According to him it is related to Pytlzonz'sscz (thcplzosa), but has
only sim eyes. If we imagine to ourselves a Gnaplzosa without the anterior
central eyes, and with the posterior row eurved strongly backwards, we have
much about the same position of the eyes 35 111 leysa. But this animal
