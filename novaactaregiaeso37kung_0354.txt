differs also in other respects from Gomphosa, as e. g. it is stated that ”the
head is considerably elevated above the thorax, especially anteriorly'⁷. The
systematic position of this animal cannot yet be considered as definitely
determined: it is only provisionally that we place it in this family and next
after Gnaplzosa.

Fam. V. DYSDEROIDAE.

The spiders belonging to this family are without difficulty distinguish-
ed from all others⁷ except the Territelariae‚ by their having two edomata,
the one immediately behind tlte other, on ezceh side of the belly wear its base.
In other spiders provided with tracheal tubes as well as two air-sacs, the
former usually debouch near the spinners, rarely (Argyyroneta, Didyma,
Anyphoena?) in the middle line of the bclly. The Dysderoidae differ from
the Territelmiae principally in having the mandibular claw, when at rest,
bent inwards or obliquely inwards and backwards, not directly backwards
and in that the two posterior stigmata lead to traeheal tubes, not to tracheal
or air-sacs (⁷’pulmonary⁷’ sacs). They are, in general⁷ further distinguished by
remarkably short tarsi and long patellae, and have, as far as is known,
never eight, but only siae (or two, if the exotio genus Nops MAG LEAY belong
to them) or sno eyes. Stalz'ta Solzz'oedtez' NOB. (S. {senaria KEYSERL.) has,
curiously enough, small rudiaizencs of 6 eyes. The tarsa] claws vary greatly
in form and armature: the inferior claw is wanting about as frequently as
it is present3 the palpa] claW is always small and without teeth.

DUFOUR‚ who first discovered that Dysdera had 4 stigmata, and who
believed that these all led to trachea] or so—called pulmonary saes ¹), as in
the case of the Terricelarioe (Tetrapnemnones LA'rR.)7 united that genus with
these last mentioned or ”les araignees quadripuhnonaires'⁷ ²), and was in
this followed by LArRfflLLE ³). SUNDEVALL4) and WALCKENAER 5) however
powerfully opposed a so one-sided over-estimation of an anatomical pecu-

only peculiarly modified tracheae‚ has been shown by LEUCKART (Ueb. d. Bau u. d.
