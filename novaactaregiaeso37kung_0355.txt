liarity‚ which moreover7 as DUGES 1) shortly after showed, had not even
been correctly understood, since the posterior stigmata do not⁷ like the
anterior, lead to trachea] savos, but to a pair of tracheal tubes. The
Dysderoidae are now generally admitted to stand in nearcr relationship to
SUNDEVALL'S Drassz'des than to his illygyalides. WALCKENAER Ἄ) was, I be-
lieve, the first who considered them as a separate group comparable with
our families3 they were by him called ”Tubicoles⁷': the name Dysderides
they received from O. KOCH (loc. eit). This family is also adopted by
BLACKWALL. lVES‘rRING includes it in his Drassz'doe, and SIMON in his ”Brassi-
f0)·mes’' (as a separate '⁷t1·ibus'⁷‚ ''Seyestrz‘ens ou Pulino-to·ache'ens’'), i. e. in
our szhitelarioe.

The genus Nalm, which SIMON refers to his '’Drasssiens” (ad max.
part. = Drassoz'doe NOB.) belongs probably to the Dyscleroz'clw: Oonf. MAG
LEAY‚ On some new forms of Arachn.7 p. 2 et seq. In that paper (p. 4)
we read of another spider, which MAG LEAY also refers to the Dysderoidoe:
”1 possess specimens of a translucid West Indian spider closely allied to
Filiscaca, and having Mygalidous eyes situated 011 the balloon-shaped cepha-
lothorax of a Nopsz In these specimens the antennae [mandibles], maxillae
etc. are so rudimentary and ineonspicuous, as would almost make us doubt
that the species ean be au animal of prey, did we not find it make an
irregular web in the eorners and crevices of houses. Ι call it He222e2·aclme 3)

than to the Dyscleroz‘clce or Filistatoz'cloe.
