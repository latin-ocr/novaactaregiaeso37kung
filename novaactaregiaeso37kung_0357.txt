ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 155

Gen. 3. ARIADNE SAv. et AUD. 1825—27.
Deriv.: Ἀριάδνη, Ariadne, mythol. proper name.

Syn„- 1525—27. Ariadne [Ariadna] SAV. et Am», Dcscr. de l'Egypte, OEd. 22) XXII, p. 308.
1837, Dysdera WALCK.² H. N. d. Ins. Apt.‚ Ι, p. 261 (ad part„- ”30 Fam. Les
Ariadnes, Ao*z'aclna'⁷).
1564, Π Sur, Η. N. d. Araignees‚ p. 105 (ad partem).

Type: Ariadne insidiatrix (F ORSK.).

In everything, except the position of the eyes⁷ Ariadne comes much
nearer to Seyestria than to Dysdera‚ to which last genus it has been ag-
gregated by WALCKENAER and several others. LATREILLE 1) and C. KOCH ²)
however recognize it as an independent genus. Like Seyestria‚ Ariadne is
remarkable for keepz'ny the 3 first pairs of Zeys stretclzed forwwds, and only
the 4¹¹¹ pair backwards. — A. insidiatrix, of which Ι have specimens which
Ι caught in Rome, where that species is common, is in habits and industry
quite similar to Seyestrz‘a Florentina and Filiscata testacea. -— I am not aware
that any species of this genus has previously been adduced as belonging
to the fauna of Europe.

The orthography Ariadne is surely preferable to Ariadna, as being
the ordinary Latin form of the word. — Of Ariadne DOLESCH. vid. p. 63.

The superior tarsal claws in A. insidiatrix are stout and powerful,
pretty much and rather uniformly curved, gradually diminishing in breadth
from the base⁷ with 7-8 coarse, somewhat divergent comb-teeth3 the in-
ferior claw is small but powerful⁷ with one little tooth. The superior tarsal
claws on the 41¹¹ pair have but about 4 teeth. The female's palpa] claw is
small and toothless.
