with the spider described by KEYSERLING ¹) as St. toenarz'a, which⁷ as 8011Ιό1)-
ΤΕ suspected, is quite a different species from the genuine Sc. toenarz‘a
so accurately described by this latter author. This is in fact easily
seen since the appearance of SCHIoDTE’S paper: On the genus Stalita 2), in
which special attention has been paid to the points in which the last men-
tioned spider differs from KEYsERLING's description. Of KEYSERLING’S spe-
cies Ι possess a full-grown Q, 8¹¹¹¹¹¹· long, exclusive of the mandibies, which
are of 2¹¹¹¹¹¹· length; it agrees in every essential particular with the descrip-
tion given by KEYSERLING. The length of the cephalothorax is 5¹¹¹¹¹¹·, and
the breadth full 3¹¹¹m‘‚ the breadth of the pars cephalica little more than 2¹¹¹¹¹¹·.
The length of the pars cephalica is a little greater than its breadth‚ and
it is tapering behind. The mandibles are thinly covered with hairs on the
whole of the dorsa] sursace, but more thickly hairy at the extremity‚ along
the claw-furrow The posterior edge of the claw-furrow has two teeth.
The last joint of the palpus is longer and slenderer than the preceding
joint. The patellae are destitute of spines The superior tarsa] claws are
long, slender, and much curved⁷ with about 13 long, closely set coinb-teeth3
the toothless part of the claw is very long and much bent dowmvards. The
inferior claw is long, slender and abruptly inflected downwards, and without
teeth. All this refers to the lst pair of legs. On the ΔΝ pair the claws
are still longer and slenderer, with about 6 divergent tceth near the base.
The palpa] claw is small and toothless. The abdomen is 4}¹¹¹'1¹* long and
2}¹¹¹¹¹¹‘ broad, with thin fine hairs. The posterior stigmata are as broad as
the anterior.

A particular interest is attached to this spider, (which Ι call S.
Sammaei), from the circumstance of its having sia: ruclz'mentmy eyes! In
position these eyes agree nearest with those of Ariadne (which genus also,
like Sicania, has 3 claws on the tarsi). They are small like points, about
equal in size⁷ and rather lighter in colour than the cephalothorax⁷ and there-
fore easily visible with a good common magnifying le11s7‘and occupy an
area the breadth of which is about a third of that of-the head, and which
is about three times as broad as it is long. They are arranged in two
rows very near the‘ margin ot theclypeus, 4 eyes in the posterior7 and 2
in the anterior row. The posterior row is straight and considerably longer
than the anterior. The two posterior central eyes are somewhat nearer to
each other than to the latera] eyes. The distance between the two lateral
eyes is about two eye-diameters‚ and perhaps somewhat greater than the
