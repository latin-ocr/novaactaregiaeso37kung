distance between the two anterior eyes and the very low clypeus, and cqual
to about ᾗ ot’ the distance between the two anterior eyes. — The specimen
of S. Sclzz'oedtez' here described was kindly presented to mc by Count KEY-
SERLING.

As to S. temam-ia, which shows no traces of eyes, Ι need but refer

to SCHIODTE'S description of that specics (locis eit).

Gen. 5. DYSDERA LATR. (1804).
Deriv.: δύσδηρις, hard to contend with (dm, ill-3 δῆρις, contention) ¹).

Type: Dysdera punctorz'a (Vim). (D. ez‘ytlzrz'na WALCK.).

The tarsa] claws in this genus are only two in number, and a claw-
tuft is met with under them, whereas in Ariadne and Haoymctes, which are
usually united with Dysdera‚ there are 3 claws, and no claw-tuft (as is the
case with all spiders that have 3 claws). The superior tarsal claws are
slender‚ somewhat sinuated at the base, outwards curved strongly and al-
most into a semicircle, with several (in D. pmzctoria about 10, in D. punc-
tata O. KOGH about 5) long saw-teeth, issuing from the side of the olaw
from about its middle to near the extremsty, which is thus rather short.
The claw—tuft is thickly set, and consists of linear hairs, slightly dilated at

the extremity only. The palpal claw is small and toothless.

Gen. 6. HARPACTES TEMPLETON. 1834.
Deriw: ἆρπακτής, robber (ἀρπάζω, rob).
