158 T. Trionem,

Not only the presence of a third tarsal claw, but also peculiarities
in the structure of the parts of the mouth, and a longer, slenderer form of
the body, distinguish this genus from Dysdera‚ to which it is otherwise very

similar, and with whieh it is commonly united. -— The superior tarsal claws ·

of the typical species are slender, curved nearly to a semicircle, and pro-
vided with about 6 long, parallel, vertical comb-teeth. The inferior claw

is toothless.
The genus Pgslarus HENTZ ¹) is near related to Hmyoactes.

Type: Oonops pulcher TEMPL.

The typical species of this interesting genus, of which the Rev. O. P.
CAMBRIDGE has kindly sent me specimens, is found not only in Great Britain
and 1reland, but also in Italy, according to CANESTRINI and PAVE312).

The two tarsal claws of O. pulcher are weak and slender, uniformly
and rather slightly bent, with 5 or 6 tolerably coarse, pointed comb—tceth
directed somewhat forwards. In stead of a claw, the female's palpus is at
the extremity provided with a strong conical process (in a young specimen).
By the presence of a small separate claw-joint this spider forms a transi-
tion to the Scytodoz'dae; I place it among the Dyscleroidoe principally on the
authority of BLACKWALL‚ for I have not myself been able to see more than
two stigmata in the somewhat damaged specimens I possess.
