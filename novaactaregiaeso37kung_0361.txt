6 spinners, the mandibular claw directed inwards, not baekwards, and only
two air-sacs. so that it is destitute of all the eharacteristics that usually
distinguish the spiders belonging to the sub-order Teo-rizelarioe. Even LA-
TREILLE. who first ¹) referred 11 10 1115 ”Τ11ῖ)ίΐί’ἰαε”, assigned it in his later
works, in consequence ot' the erroneous assumption that it had 4 ''pul-
monary’' sacs, to his sl'etrapnenmowes or the Territelariae. C. KOCH ἵ)
gives it the same systematic position. DUGES referred it to his ’'Mimo-
fflzatlzes'' or '’chstlzode‘s” ³), a group‚ that comprises spidcrs of widely separated
families, but which agree with each other in the structure of the mandibles.
(Oonf. p. 99). SIMON‚ who rightly insists upon the relationship of 1110 Filista-
toidae with the Drassoz'dce and other Tarbz'telarz'oe‚ forms for them a separate
''tribus⁷', '’Fz'lz'statiens ou Alfizsgyalo-c{1⁷as.9es'’, within the family '’Drassz'formes⁷’ 4).
Lastly. in AUSSERER ⁵). as also in CANESTRINI and PAVESI ⁶), we find the
family Filistatidoe placed between Misyalidoe aud Dysderz'doe.

It is strictly speaking only by the position of the eyes, that Fz'listata
agrees more 111111 1110 Territelarz'oe than with the Dzbitelarz'oe, and it seems
chiefly to have been this agreement that induced XVALCKENAER and O. KOOH
to refer Filistata to the first-named sub-order. Mandibles directed some-
what forwards and united at the base ⁷), form a feature occurring in many
other genera whioh have never been referred to the Territelariae, and especially
among the Seytodoz'ch—e, which we unreservedly consider as the nearest rela-
latives of the Filismcoidw. The parts of the mouth exhibit the same struc-
ture in both these families, and also in Filistam the weak malnlibles, armed
with a very small claW‚ remind an observer of the two-fingered claw of the
Opz'lz'ones, by their having a spine or 100111 31 their extremity opposite the
claw. Both families appear to have been developed from a common root:
the Scytodoicloe form the beginning of 1110 series of genera, which constitute
the sub-orders Retitelarioe and Oi-bz'telarioe, while from the Fz‘Zz'statoidce and
forms nearly related to them the other sub-orders have probably descended.

The general appearance of the Filistatoidae is very peculial· and un-
like that of other spiders: it reminds one most of certain Scytocloidae (Lomo-
sceles) and leeraphosoz'doe‚ but also Of some T ubitelarioe, e. g. Uroctea. Their
