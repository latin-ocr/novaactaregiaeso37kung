generally strong extemities, as also their habits and the structure of their
webs at once separating them from the Retitelarioe, they cannot be referred
to any other sub-order than the Tubitclariae. If by a certain outward ap-
pearance, by the structure of the mandibles, and by the form and armature
of the feinale’s palpi, they exhihit affinities with the Urocteoidae‚ they, on
the other hand, as LUCAS ¹) has remarked, and as I have myself in Southern
Europe observed, agree with Seyestrz'm and especially with S. Florentina, in
their habits and economy: the tubular weh has just the same appearance,
and is met with in the same localities (especially in the holes and crevices
of old walls), as that of the last mentioned spider. Also HENTZ remarks
concerning this genus, that ”by its habits it is closely related to Pylarus
and to Seyestria” ²).

Type: Filismta testacea LATR.

In the typical species the superior tarsal claws are very strong, long,
much and unitormly curved, with about 12 long, strong, almost parallel, almost
equally long comb-teeth3 the free extremity of the claw is not long, a little
swelled at the root below. The inferior claw is very small, but strong, with
two very long, strong teeth, sitting close together. The palpal claw of Q
is long, of almost uniform substance, much and regularly curved, arnied
from the base throughout about two thirds of its length with about 16 rather
short, strong, parallel eomb-teeth slightly increasing in length outwards, the
points of which form a much curvcd line following the direction of the claw.
