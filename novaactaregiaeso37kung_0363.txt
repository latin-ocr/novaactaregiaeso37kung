ΟΝ EUROPEAN Spumans. 161

mandibular claw: it moves, as is known, 111 a vertical plane very nearly
parallel to the longer axis of the body, and, when at rest, is directed back-
wards: in all other spiderson the contrary, it moves 111 a plane almost at
right angles to the longer axis of the body, and lies with its point turned
immam—Is, sometimes obliqnely inwards and backwards. The mandibles
themselves are generally more projeeting and larger than in other spiders,
and ean only be opened to an inconsiderable amount. The Territelariae
have generally four air-Saos, the spinners are with few exceptious only four
111 number: the superior are usually considerably longer than the inferior,
and consist of three, sometimes (at least in the genera Dz'plura C. KOCH
and Eriodon LATR. or lllissulena WALCK.) of four joints. The tarsal elaws
are mostly two, sometimes three 111 number.

The Territelariae approximate 011 the one side to the Tubz'celarioe (Fi-
lz's'catoidae and Dysderoidoe) and on the other to the Citzyz²ad(·e. The genus
Catadysas HEN'rZ forms an evident transition to this latter sub-order, with
which they also in their habits show many analogies. That some of the
female Theraphosoidae carry their young upon their baeks, just like species
of the genus Lycosa, has been long known: LATREILLE states it to be the
case With Nemesia Sauvayesz'z' (ROSSI) or lllyyale fodiens WALCK. ¹), and AB·
BOT has, according to WALCKENAER ²), observet] the same pliaenomenon 111
Actinopus Abbotiz' (WALCK.). LINCECUM relates 3) concerning certain species
found 111 Texas: ”Two 01· three speeies of sssyyale carry a sack well filled
with eggs attached to the tz'p of their abdomen, and when the young ones
hatch out, they take them on their backs and carry them like the Myyale
Hentzz'iff'

The European Territelariae all belong to one family, the leeraplzo-
soicloe, all the species of which have four pulmonary sacs, and at least four
spiuners. Of the families Lz'plzz'stz'oz'dce and Catadysoidoe see pag. 43.
