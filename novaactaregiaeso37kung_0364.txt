It is well known that OUVIER in the year 1800 gave the name of
lllyyale to a genus of Maw'nmals, and that WALCKENAER first in 1802 (”(1’3115
1111 Memoire lu a la Societe Philomatique de Paris’⁷: see WALCK., Faune
Parisienne, II, p. 249) separated the spiders belonging to the family before
us from the others or ''spiders properly so called'’ (Aranea WALCK.) under
the name of BIgfsmle. Some naturalists have curiously enough attempted to
avoid the confusion thus introduced, by altering CUVIER'S generic name into
sslyogyale or sssyogyalea —— which however is only another way of spelling
JlIyyaZe — instead of, in accordance with the law of priority‚ altering the
more recent name or replacing it with another, as reasonableness requires.
It 6311 moreover hardly be denied that the name ruiwale, as that of a ge-
nus of spiders‚ is ill chosen: the Greek word μυγαλῆ, μυγαλέη or μυογοῑλη
signifies a slzrew (Soram), and nothing else. Nevertheless, in spite of the
requirements of consistency, we should perhaps not have ventured ,to ex-
change this generally known and accepted generic name for another, if the
following circumstances had not contributed to induce 115 to such a step.
First and principally the genus Misgyale has by more recent authors been
resolved into several smaller generic groups, by C. KOCH ¹) for inst. into
seven, so that by him the name of Mjesqale is only retained for a group
comprising but two species, M. Blondz'i and M. Javanensz‘3‚ whereas all
the other forms described by him bear other generic 11311165- 31111 the mat-
ter is accordingly reduced merely to the giving of another name to the
above mentioued little group; moreover that other name needs not be a new
31111 previously unknown denomination, for we have at hand an appropriate
generic name formed by WALGKENAER himself in 1805, namely Theraphosa,
which in the original definition of that genus is absolutely synonymous with
Myyale. This word is not, as has been sometimes supposed, a plural, but
a true generic name in the singular number ²), and has already in 1830
been used by EICHWALD 3) instead of Alsgsyale. In the Tableau des Arane-
ides WALOKnNAER divided ”les Arane‘z'des'⁷ into two great ''Divisions⁷⁷,
