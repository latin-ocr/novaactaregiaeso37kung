leeraplzosa and Amnem (just as he had before divided them into All-'zsffale
and Arnum), after which each of these great generie groups was snbdivided
into a number of smaller groups, '’gcln·es⁷': leeraplwsa into Mmale, Ole-
tera and sslissulenffi Aranea into Lycosa, Dolomedes, Ctenvs ete. The name
Arnum has been entirely abandoned as a generie name, simply because
the whole Order of Spiders ought to be called Amnem,- but any sound reason
for not preserving the name leeraplzosa for some portion of the forms to
which 11 has 01166 belonged, it would assuredly be hard to assign. We
propose therefore with EICHWALD to replacc the name lllyyale, which had
already been appropriated by CUVIER‚ with T Ιιεναρήοεα, giving Th. Blova'iz·
as type of the genus. leeraplzosa (WALOK.) NOB. is therefore = Myqale
(WALCK.) C. KooH 1850.

We also desire to eall attention to the following circumstance. When7
in 1811⁷ OLIVIER ¹) adopted WALCKENAER'S genus Myyale as separate from
Aminea, he restricted it to ”les Arcn’gyoze'es vzzinffl‹ses⁷’‚ exeluding all the other
Ilefgyale-SIJGCies 01· ”les Araisme'es aviculaires'’‚ Which he referred to Amarea.
He was followed by LAMARCK 2), who also (in the year* 1818) received into
the genus Alygyale only ”les Araignees mineuses⁷'; but tor ”les Araignees
aviculaires'' this author formed a separate genus, Avicularz'ct LAM.3), It
was not till several years later (1825), that LATREILLE gave to ''Zes Arai-
yne‘es minezcses'' the name '' Ctenz'ze''‚ and in opposition to OLIVIER’S and LA-
MARCK'S limitation of the genus sslgsyalee, applied that name to ”les Araigsne‘es
aviculaz'res’ss It is accordingly evident that {f the name Mygyale were to be
preserved to any genus of spiders at all, it ought, according to the law of
priority‚ to belong to that genus which is usually called C'teniza LATR.
(Nemesion SAV. et AUD.). -— We have preferred the denomination T lterapltosa
to that of Avia-ularia for the species of ”les Araignees aviculaires⁷'⁷ which
in KOCH and SIMON bear the name of Allyyale, and thus have been by them
considered as types of the genus My‘csale I‘VALCK.. partly because Thera-
plzosa is the older appellation of the two, partly because the name Avicula-
ria ought 111 0111· opinion to be reserved for that group of speeies among
71166 Mygales aviculaii·es''‚ which eomprises LINNE'S Arcaea avicularia. (Vid.
p. 169 sub gen. Avicularia (LAM.)).

We divide provisionally ''les Mygales aviculaires⁷⁷ into the 4 follow-
ing genera⁷ which number will however doubtless hereafter, when· these
animale have been more accurately studied, be eonsiderably augmented:
