The synonyms show that the nama Atypus has the right of priority
before Oletera, and not vice versa, as LUGAs 1) has supposed.

Type: Cyrtauchenius PValclrenaerii (LUCAS)‚

The name Cynocephalus having been already disposed of, before 11
was applied by LUGAS 10 11118 genus (conf. p. 36, note 2), I have been
obliged to give it a new denomination. — Ι possess a specimen (a Q) of
a species of Cyrtauclzem'us, from Coi-fn, given 10 1110 by Oount KEYSERLlNG,
which is perhaps identical, or at least very closely connected⁷ with O. Za-
pz'darz‘us (LUC.) from Crete. It is distinguished by the palpi as well as
the first two pairs of legs being towards the extremities (on the last three
j0ints of the legs and the last two of the palpi), on both sides and for
some distance downwards, armed with a band of, especially on the last
joint, closely arranged, 811011, 11111111, very strong 81111108, which undoubtedly
make these extremities excellent digging organs. On the ΒΜ and 4t¹¹ pairs
these joints only show a few sparse spines. Of the palpi of C. lapidarius
LUCAS ²) states, that between the hairs that cover 1110111, 0110 may remark
''des 01111108 place'es ςὰ et ἰὰ”, and of the legs of the same species, that it
