brun rougeatre⁷'. In other respects LUCAS' description accurately eorresponds
with the spider I have mentioned. Should this spider be found not identical
With C. lapidarius, it may be called Ο. Οονσμναεῑιε.

SIMON (loc. cit.) enters under the genus Cynocephalus [-a] a species
²⁷0. lapidaria ROULIN, Ile de Cuba'', which is probably a slip of the pen for
”C. lapidaria LUCAS, Ile de Or'ete''. He has however not inserted this
genus in his Catal. syn. d. Araneides d’Europe.

The tarsal elaws of Cyrtauclzem'us are 3 in number on each tarsus,
as in Nemesin. The tarsi of the posterior legs are somewhat thicker towards
the extremity, almost clublike. The superior or posterior spinners show
only 3 distinctly separated joints.

Gen. 3. NEMESIA SAv. et AUD. 1825—27.
Deriv.: Νεμέσιος or Νέμεσις, mythol. proper name.

The most commonly received name of this genus is not Nemesion,
but Ormiza, which name is first found in LATREILLE'S Familles Naturelles
du Regne Animal (1825), where ''Zes Alo-<myndos mineuseffl' are brought to-
gether under the French appellation ’'Ctezzice''. VVhether the scz'entzflc name
was intended to be Ctenz'zus, Ctenz'za or any thing else, it is not possible
to see there, for the generie names, even those newly formed, appear
in that work only iu their French form, whence also follows (Oonf. p. 4
note 1), that any right of priority cannot be claimed for the generie names
there proposed. It is true that BERTHOLD, in his German translation of LA-
TREILLE⁷S Familles N aturelles (1827), gave a Latin form to these new generie
denominations 1), and in the cases, in which he was the first who did so

1) He however calls LATREILLE'S ⁷⁷Ctenize²' not etenim, but Otenize, as the ge-
nus is also called by for inst. SUNDEVALL (Consp. Aracha, 1. 28). That LATREILLE'S
meaning was, that the name should end i cc, is visible 111 his subsequam works, as
e. g. in the edition of Cuvrssrt's Regne Animal published 111 1829, and it has since
generally received that termination.
