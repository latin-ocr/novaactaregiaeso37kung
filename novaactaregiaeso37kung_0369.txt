ΟΝ EUROPEAN 8111116115. 167

(35 15 undoubtedly the case with the name in question), 1116111116 of the na-
me's publication must bc rcckoned from that translatiou3 but SAVIGNY and
AUDOUIN had, it' I niistakc not, a little before its appearance, given the
name of Nemesin. to a species belonging to the ''mining'’ spiders, and this
name, as probably somewhat older, Ι have considered mysels bounden to
perfer to Cteniza BERTH.

SIMON has exchanged (Nemesia and) Cteniw for an entirely new
name, lllygmlodonta, and says concerning Ctenz'm (loc. cit. p. 76) that ”cette
denomination 651 165166 111601111116”. 11 1135 therefore escaped his observation,
that that name is both known and used in a work that he osten cites,
KOCH'S Die Arachniden, and SIMON even himself cites (p. 453) in 1115 36-
count of his lllyyalodonta fodiens: ⁷⁷ Ctem'm Grcgja KOCH'⁷.

That the name Almam, if it could be used of 3 genus of spiders‚
would by right belong to the genus before 115, Ι have already (p. 163)
endeavoured to show.

N eellz'eola, according to O. G. COSTA 1), 15 met with, though rarely,
in the south of Italy⁷ 31 Ν311165. COS'rA states that it 1135 3 claws upon
the tarsi of 1116 3¹²¹ 11311· only⁷ the first pair being armed with 2, and the
§jud with but one claw respectively (1). According to SAVIGNY and AUDOUIN2)
this species has however three claws on each of the tarsi, like other spe-
6165 of the genus.

Q.

This genus, corresponding with those of WALCKENAER'S '’llsygyales
digyz'tz’yrades inermes’', which have very elongated superior spinners, consisting
os 4 distinet joints, belongs to the European Spider-Fauna at 16351 through
Illyyale Calpetano [Calpez'ana] WALcK.‚ Which, according 10 WALCKENAER'S
description 3), 111 11115 feature agrees with the species, D. macrum O.
