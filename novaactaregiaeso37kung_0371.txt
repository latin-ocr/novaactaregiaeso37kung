ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 169

As we remarked above (p. 163), LAMARCK divides WALCKENAER’S
*llys-mile into two genera, Aufeiam-ia and llsygyale, of which the former is
synonymous with Allyyale LATR.‚ the latter with Ctenz'za [LATR] BERTH. or
Nemesin SAV. et AUD. As type for Avioularz'a LAM.‚I propose Arama avi-
cularia LINN. (Ar. vestiaria DE GEER, Avieularz'a canceridea LAM.)‚ partly for
the sake of the name, and partly because it is the first species entered by
LAMARGK under the genus Avicularz‘a. As it was for this species and forms
nearly related to it, that C. KOCH proposed the genus Eurgspelma‚ it will be
to the species of that genus that the older name Avicularia ought in the first
place to be applied. The other new genera cited in our Syn„ which KOOH
formed at the eost of WALCKENAER'S ''lllyyales plantiyracles'’, may probably for
the present be united with Eurypelma or Avienlarz'a.

Ι am not convinced, that any species belonging to this genus is met
with in Europe. As however SIMON in his snb-genus Eurypelma —— which he
states to have '’tarses elargis, garnis de brosses adherentes, griffes tres-
1·etraetiles'⁷, and which thus by these characteristics agrees with Avieulasria
(LAM.) NOB. — includes e. g. Alsygmle (Trechooza) icterica C. Kocfl from
Greece, which species is to me unknown, I consider that I ought, at least
provisionally, to insert here the genus Avicularz‘a.]

Sub-ordo V. LATERIGRADAE.

Sym: vid. infra sub Fam. 77aomz'soz'doe,

In their peculial· manner of lnoving —- with about as much ease
sideways or backwards as forwards, and with their femora depressed and
strete-hed out sideways, the following joints of the legs moving towards the
femora in a plane more nearly approaching the horizontal than the vertical
plane —— the spiders belonging to this sub-order have a distinctive mark,
by which, as is well known, they may usually without difficulty be distin-
guished from all other spiders. Of the European genera, Microosnmata (LATR.)
is the only one, which has not the crab-like appearance that is peculial· to
the other Laterigradae. Many of the great exotie forms of this sub-order
(especially those ot the genus Ηεῑενοροάα), present a striking analogy with
certain Theraphosoz'dae; but it is to the Donassoz‘dae in the sub-order Tabite-
Zarz'ce, that the Laterigradae are most nearly related, and between which
and them it is most difficult to assign the line of demareation. Like the
