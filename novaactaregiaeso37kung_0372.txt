1 70 T. THORELL,

Drassoidse, they have only two claws at the extremity of the tarsi ¹): as in
them, the eyes generally form two transversal rows3 but these rows usually
enclose a crescent-shaped or circular-segmental area, and are but rarely
nearly parallel or curved towards each other 2). Most frequently (also in
illicrommata) the second pair of legs is longer than the others, which on
the other hand, as far as I am aware, is never the case with the Drassoz'-
dee. The maxillae are usually narrow and strongly inclined towards the la-
bium, the mandibles small and conical: nevertheless there are numerous ex-
ceptions to this, of which Heteropoda and the genera nearly connected with
it are striking examples.

The species of this sub-order, at least the European ones, may for
the present be united in a single family, Tltomz‘soz‘dae, to which we also
refer the wonderful and but little known genus Aneces· MENGE, which is
stated to be destitute of both spinners and tarsal claws.

LATREILLE in 1804 3) formed, at the expense of LINNlll'S Aranea, for
spiders belonging to this family the genera Heteropocla‚ Mismnena and Mi-
crommata. As the characteristic difference between the two first mentioned,

1) A remarkable exception is Sparassus abnormis BLACKW., which has only ”a
single claw at the extremity of each tarsns'' (nmmum, A list of spiders captured
in the South-East region of Equat. Africa, p. 457). This species ought probably to
form a separate genus.

2) In Eripus WALCK. the eyes are arranged in 3 or 4(?) transversal series. In
Platythomfisus Donnscn. the eyes form two thmb-like groups‚ situated far apart
at the two corners of the forehead3 in Arcys WALCK., IIeteroqnatlza NIC. and Ane-
tes MENGE on the contrary the lateral eyes are far removed fron] the central eyes,
much about as in Epeira. In Steplzawopis CAMBR. the eyes are arranged in a ring,
in Diplzsssa Nm. they have again about the same position as in Oeyale. leomisus yolo-
phas DOUM. has but 6 eyes, and ought of course to form a separate genus, for
which we propose the name Duo-adius (from Daradus, the river Senegal)3 Sicarius
WALCK.01· Tltomz'soz'des Nic„ which, I suspect, belongs to this family, has also only 6 eyes.
