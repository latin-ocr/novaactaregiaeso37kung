they are in Misumena ''brusqncnient plus mcnues 01 plus courtes quc les
antrcs’', which is not the case in Iseteropoda. illiorommata, according to
LATREILLE, differs from both these genera in having the maxillae straight,
not inclined to the labium. The next year WALCKENAER (in Tableau des
Araneides) united Heteropoda and Misumena in one genus, which 110 0311οᾶ
leomz'sus, instead of retaining for it, as in justice he ought to have done,
one 01 1110 Latreillian names. The genus Micrommata hc adopted unaltcred,
but gave also 10 11 3 new name, Spar-assus 1). Ι11 1110 Τ3111. des Aran.,
fZ'lzomz‘sus is divided into three sections: ”les Hete'ropocleffl’, auswering to
Misnmena, and '’les Eqm'pcaedes brdvz‘rostres’⁷ and y'les Equipc‘des Zoozyirostres”,
both together answering to Iieteropoda LATR. In Faune franc, Arachn.,
Livr. 11 et 12 (1825 Ῥ), 1110 French forms of WALCKENAER⁷S Thomisus
were by that author again divided between two genera, Plzz'lodronws and
Thomisus, 1110 first of which corresponds to a part of Heteropoda LATR.‚
the last to Misumena LATR. In the same work, a few years later (1830),
the genus Delena- was proposed (p. 110): afterwards WALCKENAER, as is
known, created or adopted several new genera formed at the expense 01
his Thomz'sus: Selenops, olentes, Arcys, Erz'pus, Olios (= Sarotes SUND.). —
WALCKENAER soon perceived the intimate connexion between Allz'crommata
LATR. or Sparassns and the spiders, which in his Tabl. d. Aran. form the
8ῐ11 family of leomisus (Thom. Zeucosz'us or Ar. venatoria LINN. and others,
for which he afterwards formed the genus otios->2 111 Faune F 13110, 100. 011,
we even find these latter referred to Sperassus, whereas LATREILLE had united
them with the species of Philodromus, with which they have far less affi-
nity. — The very different development of the posterior, compared with
the anterior extremities in sllisumena or Thiomisus 011 1110 0110 side, and He-
teropoda (Plzilodromus) and Allz'erommata on the other, probably still affords
the best basis for the division 01 1110 Thom‘soidoe into larger groups, after
the resolution of these old genera into a number of smaller; this basis has
gained increased stability since attention has been called (by DUGES, OH-
LERT, and others) to the presence of hair-w s (claw-brushes, claw-tufts, as
I call them) under the tarsal claws in the last two Latreillian genera, and
the absence 01 1110111 111 1110 first-named. SIMON also divides, chiefly 01111131

1) LATREILLE soon submitted in part to this usurpation, and himself adopted a
couple (Thomz'suffl Plzz'loclromus) of the names imposed by WALCKENAER. But this
of course does not author-ize us here any more than elsewhere to neglect the law ot
priority.
