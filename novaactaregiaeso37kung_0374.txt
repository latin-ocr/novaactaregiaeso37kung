misiens’'‚ uniting Mic-rovmnata (Sparassus) with the former 1). The same
two groups are also adopted by PRACH ²), who calls them Plzilodromz' and
Cancroides. According to our method they constitute sub-famifies, and may
be called Philodrominoe and Thomisinoe. The sub-family slvzetinoe we have
added merely provisionally for the as yet too imperfeetly known genus
Anetes MENGE.

The exotio genus Art-ys WALCK. 3) ought, it seems to ine, to be con-
sidered as the type of a separate sub-family, Arcgsz'ozoe, which shows strong
analogies with certain Epeiroidoe, as Gasteracantlza (SUND.) and Peniza
‚THOR ⁴³). With the Arcyinae, Anetes might perhaps also be united.

Wns'rnnve and BLACKWALL have divided the Thomz‘soidce belonging
to the European Fauna, with which they were acquainted, into only three
genera, Thomz'suffi Philodromus and SparassuS. O. KOOH detaehed from Tho-
mz‘sus the genus Χῃετὶσιιε, and from Philodromus the genera Artamus and
{Nummus ⁵), which three new genera have been adopted by SIMON‚ OHLERT
and others. SIMON adds oue more European gemm, Oaeyptila ⁶). SIMON
however in a paper lately published ⁷) has abandoned his former division
of the Thomisoidae. Not satisfied with taking the genus Thomisus in as
extensive a meaning as that which it bears in VVALCKENAER'S latest works,
he also unites with it Monastes LUC. (illonoeses ΝΘΕ), and even wishes to
suppress Philodromus WVALGK.‚ because that genus only differs fron] Tko-
misus, ”by a greater equality between the eight legs.'' But the greater part
of the European genera of e. g. the family Attoz'dae adopted by SIMON Β),
are most assuredly as nearly connected with each other, and exhibit among
· themselves quite as evident transitions as the above Thomisoid genera, and
it eannot be right in estimating the value of generic eharaeteristies to follow
one rule with one family and another with another ⁹).

by Prof. LEUCKART‚ which appears to be identical with A. laneam-ius WALCK. Spe-
eies of that genus have else only been found in South America (Brazil, Chili).

9) The very principle on which Snuon's view of the connexion of the above-
mentioned Thomisoid genera appears to rest, viz. that all genera, which gradually
pass into each other, ought to be united in one, appears to me quite wrong. The
ease is just the same with genera as with families, orders, classes, ete, nay even
