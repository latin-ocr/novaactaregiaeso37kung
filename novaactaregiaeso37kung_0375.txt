ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 173

We arra-nge the Europeau Tlioinisoidae under the following genera:

ξ Mamillae ut et ungues in apice tarsoruin adsunt.

³² Pedes 4 posteriores reliquis non vel parum graciliores, saepissime iis non vel
parum breviores. Tarsi in apice sub unguibus fasciculis duobus pilorum plus
minus dilatatorum instructi ........... Ι. PHILODROMINAE.

A. Utraque oculorum series ex oculis 4 composita.

α. Oculi medii antici vix vel non longius a margine clypei quam a me-
diis posticis remoti. Maxillae plerumque rectae et parallelae. (Fasciculi
unguiculares spississimi, ex pilis longis, tenuibus, in ipso apice tau-
tum paullo dilatatis constantes).

1. Series oculorum antica paullo recurva, postica, desuper visa, paullo
procurva. (Oculi intermedii in trapezium antice angustius dispositi).
Genua pedum altius elevata.. . . . . . . . i. illierommata.

with the two great main divisions of the organic world, the animal and vegetable
kingdoms: all these various kinds of systematic unities have been formed on
the strength of a certain, greater or less, number of common features, which the
natural productions united under them seem to us to possess, and although we see
now a greater, now a less saltus between the most nearly related coordinate groups,
yet the differences in this respect do not affect the propriety of considering them
as independent genera, families, orders. etc., provided only their typical forms
show the amount of peculiarities, which one assumes to be necessary for a· group
to be acknowledged as possessiug the significancy of a genus, family, ete, and
provided some sure, even if insignificant, feature can be pointed out as determining
in doubtful cases the limit of the group. The groups, which, like e. g. the ymera
Dinopz‘s and Hyptz‘otes among Spiders, or like this and most other orders within
the class of Araehnoidea, do not exhibit transitions to any other group, are
comparatively few3 and how vast differences in this respect are visible between e. g.
the different orders of the class (Ji-astacon on the one and of the Araelmoidea on the
other hand! And yet surely no one will deny, that for inst. Oopepocza and Brcmcltz'o-
poda are as natural and rational orders as Aranese and Opiliones, although the
boundary between the former is not so sharply defined, hut that the same genus
(e. g. Aryztlus) is referred by some authors to the Copepoda and by others to the
Branchiopoda. Precisely similar to the relation between these two orders, is that
between many ymera, and among them that between Tltomz'fflffi, Monaeses and
Philoclromus: transitions there are, it is true, but the groups are οη the whole and in
their typical forms sufficiently different, to deserve their separate denominations and
the rank in the system, which it has hitherto been customary to give them. — The
more new forms (especially fossile ones) are discovered, the more the intervals between
a number ot' genera and of higher groups, which had previously been considered as
widely separated, are filled up. If we were fully acquainted with the entire animal
and vegetable world, both the now living and the eminet, all such gaps would as-
suredly be filled up, and the truth of the old adage: natura non facit saltus, would
stand out in all its grandeur.
