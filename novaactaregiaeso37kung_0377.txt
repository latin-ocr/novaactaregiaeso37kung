The powerful development of the posterior extremities gives the spi-
ders of this sub-family that quickness and lightness of motion in which
they so remarkably excell the Τ lwmz'sz'nce. — The claws are long and slender⁷
generally straight or somewhat sinuated (i. e. slightly curved in the form of
an ω) the greater part ot' their length, with only the extremity bent down
to a hook. The claw-tufts vary in length and density, but are always pre-
sent. — We assign the genus Selenops to this sub-family3 by SIMON it is
referred to the T homisinoe, because the eyes in that genus are of clfferent
sizes, which he considers as one of the features by which the Thorni-
sinae are distinguished from the Philodrominae. This is however no reliahle
characteristic, and indecd SIMON himself7 in his description of the genus
Thoirzz'szcs, says: ’'yeux eg·aux'' ¹).

1) The exotic genus Delena WALCK. also we refer to the Philodrominae, and
not, as is done by 51111οΝ, to the Thomisinae. Its hindei· pairs of legs are indeed
not inconsiderably shorter than the fore legs, but they are about equ'al to them in
strenytlz; and by the presence of strong claw-brushes, by the form of the claws
themselves, and the powerfully developed scopulae under the metatarsi and tarsi, as
well as by its general appearance, Delma, betrays a close affinity to Heteropocla.
