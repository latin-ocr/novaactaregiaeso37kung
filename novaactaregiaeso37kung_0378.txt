LATREILLE‚ in Nouv. Diet. d'Hist. Nat, l. c.. states that his Micrommata
eomprises the spiders that WALCKENAER calls ”les Grottiformes'’ (Faune
Pan, II, p. 225), i. 5. Aranea snmraydula, ornata, rosea (aud A. accen—
tuam, which is placed there by mistake). In Gen. Crust. et lns.⁷ Mer-om-
mam smarayclala (Ar. virescens CLERCK.) is expressly addueed as the type
of the genus. — The more recent synonym Sparsissus we reserve for those
speeies of Micrommca LATR. or Spar-assus WALCK. for which WALCKENAER
formed 1115 family ”les Opticiennes'⁷, and which in the whole 01 111511 ap—
pearance approach far nearer 10 WALCKENAER⁷S Olios (Heteropoda (LATR.)
NOB.) thau to the lSt family of his Sparassus.

By some authors, e. g. WESTRING‚ Mieromnzata is referred 10 1115
Drassoidoe. It certainly differs considerably 111 general appearance from the
more typieal Thomisoidae, the knees being 50 little depressed, that the ani-
mal ean hardly be called laterigrade; but the intimate relationship of Mi-
crommata with the evidently laterigrade species 01 1115 next genus, Sparassus
(WALOK.) NOB.. is 100 palpable to allow 01 115 being separated from· the fa-'
mily before 115 and transferred to the Drassoidae, although it may be eon-

sidered as forming the transition to these. -— The form 01 1115 claws and

elaw-brushes 15 precisely that 01 1115 next following genus.

The spiders united by HEN'rZ 1) under 1115 name of sfflcrommata, ean-
not belong to this genus, for they all have the posterior 1011Γ 01 eyes strongly
eurved baekwards, and the anterior row straight or eurved forwards. They
seem 10 approach much nearer to Dolomedes or to Dendrolycosa DOLESGH.‚
than to Micrommata, as far at least as we ean judge from the position of
the eyes as described and figured by HENTZ.
