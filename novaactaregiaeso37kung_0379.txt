Type: Sparasszcs Aryelasiz' XVALCK.

The species we have proposed as type for this new genus has, it
appears to us, been referred by O. KOGH to his Ocypete (Olios WALCK.,
Heteropoda (LATR.) NOB.), and described under the appellation of O. tersa
(loc. eit), although it has by all other writers, who have treated on it, been
considered as a Microomnata or Sparassus. From lllz‘crommata, as that ge-
nus has been limited by us, it differs in the strongly marked laterigrade
position of the legs, in its more dense scopulae, in the closer vicinity to
each other of the two rows of eyes, etc. The eyes are moreover larger,
and the anterior eentral eyes at least as large as the anterior lateral
ones. From the next following genus, Heteo-opodm it differs in that the
anterior row of eyes is curved baekward instead of being straight or eurved
somewhat forward. For this genus we have assumed the name Sparassus,
which has previously been synonymous with Micrommata, and under which
the typical speeies was first described.

In Sparassus Aryelasz'z' the tarsal claws are very long and slender
(somewhat longer still than in Micrommata), straight, only a little sinuated
towards the middle, and with the extremity turned down into a hook. The
teeth are short, blunt and pretty close together, gradually longer towards
the extremity of the claw, their points forming an almost straight 1ine3 they
are about 16 in number on the inner, and a couple less on the outer claw.
The female’s palpal elaw has about 8 tolerably strong, close-set comb-teeth,
gradually increasing in length. The hairs in the thick claw-brushes are
long and fine, with the extremity compressed, somewhat dilated, and bifid.
