Type: Heteropoda venatoria (LINN.).

The only species provided with specific name, that LATREILLE takes ‚
up loc. eit. as an example under his genus Heteropoda‚ is stranea venatoria
LINN. (Olios leucosios WALCK.) 1)7 which must accordingly be considered as
the type of the genus. According to the characteristics given by LATREILLE
to Heteropocla‚ it answers to the whole sub-family of Philocli-omnm, quite
as Misumena LATR. answers to the sub-family Thomisinae. — That a whole
Class (of Mollusca) several years afterwards (1812) should have received
the name of Heteropods (Heteropoda)‚ is certainly unfortunate, bnt this cir-
cumstance, it seems to us, cannot hinder the use of the sz'nyzzlar form He-
teropoda as a generic name, any more than the circumstance, that this name
would have been much more suitable to a Themisine than to a Philodro-
mine genus, since at any rate it is not false as applied to this last. (Conf.
p. 10, note 3).

The tarsal claws of H. venatoria are very long and slender, only
at the end bent downwards, with (011 the 21Ὶά pair) about 12· comb-teeth on
the inner claw; those nearest the base (the interior) are very close to each
other, parallel, the exterior coarse and divergent3 all are rather short,
gradually increasing a little in length towards the extremity of the claw;
on the outer claw they are less numerous and more sparse. The claw-
brushes are long and thick, every separate hair very fine and somewhat
incrassated just at the apex: 50011 111 profile it there appears to 110 serrated
011 the underside.

The genus Olz'os WALOK. seems to us to contain forms too hetero-
geneous to allow of its remaining long undivided. Its ”1ΥΘ Famille''‚ and
perhaps a couple more, belong to Heteropoda‚ as we have in p. 174 deter-
mined the limits of that genus. The same generic group, which WALCKE-
NAER calls Olios, had been previously characterized by SUNDEVALL under
the name of Sarotes. That name, the oldest synonym of Heteropocla, ought
to 110 made use of, if ever the genus comes to be divided into smaller generic
groups. The Walekenaerian name is so incorrectly formed — it is said to
be derived from ὀλοάς, ὀλοιός, destructive, and accordingly should be writ-

rent from Ar. venatoria LINN.
