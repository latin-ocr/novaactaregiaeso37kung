ten Olous or Oloens — that on that account alone it ought to be dis-
carded. Ocypete, as the genus Heteropoda has been denominated by O.
KOOH, is a name already in 1815 assigned by LEACH to a genus of Acari.

It is with doubt that l include this genus among those of Europe.
Of the four species of Olios οι· Ocypete stated to belong to the European
Fauna, one, the Ocypete tersa O. KOCH ¹), is undoubtedly identical with Spa-
rassus Aryelasiz', of which speeies I have found a specimen at Nizza, and
have received another from Spain from Mr. SIMON. The second, Ocypete
vulpina (HAHN) O. KO0H‚ described by HAHN as an Epeira‚ has according
to KOCH 2) its front row of eyes evidently eui-ved backwards, and is there-
fore surely a Sparassus (WALCK.) ΝΟΒ, The third species, which, as well
as the preceding, is unknown to me, Olz'os sponyz'mrsz's (DUF.) IVALCK. ³),
is referred by DUFOUR 4) to Micrommata (Spem-assus WALCK.)‚ and probably
also belongs to Sparassus NOB. A fourth speeies, from Naples, described by
CANESTRINI and PAVEsl ⁵), is called Ocypete ozz'yrz‘tarsz's: it is perhaps also a
Sparassus]

The typical European species is to me unknown. — In a species
from Asia Minor (Caramania)‚ belonging to the ”3¹¹¹ss Fam. Les Alphe-ermes
of the genus in IVALCKENAER (Ins. Apt.‚ I, p. 548), and which I have re-
ceived from Count KEYSERLING‚ the claws differ in appearance from those
of all other Thomisoidae known to me. They are indeed very long and
slender⁷ like those of the Philodrominae in general, but they are pretty uni--
formly curved, not straight the greatest part of their length, and entirely
destitute of teetlz. Under the claws are two strong, very thick elaw-brushes,
the hairs of which are long and fine, slightly dilated at the end⁷ as in
