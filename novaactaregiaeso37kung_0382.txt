Heteropoda‚ Mierommata, etc. The thick scopula under the tarsus and meta-
tarsus of these genera is absent in Selenops‚ which genus thus is distinguished
not by its peculiar position of the eyes alone.

It is possible that this genus may have been created already by
LATREILLE‚ in the 2¹¹st Edit. of Nouv. Dict. d’Hist. Nat, which Ι 113νο 1101
had the opportunity of consulting (Conf. DUFOUR, 100. cit). In his later
works however LATREILLE calls it: ”Selenops DUFOUR.⁷’

Artamus being the well known and accredited name of a genus of
birds, so named by VIEILLOT as early as 1816, Ι 113νο been obliged 10 give
the spider-genus Artemius a new appellation.

10 11115 and the two following genera, the hairs of the claw-tufts
have an appearance quite different from that presented in any of the genera
of the family, we have as yet described: these hairs are in fact beyond all
comparison shorter and broaders flattened, spade-like or ieamer-like, and far
less numerous (especially in Thanacus). The claws are often shorter, espe-
cially in 1710110103, but of the same form3 the teeth usually 131 more nu-
merous on the inner than 011 1110 011101· claw, in Philodr. aureolus, for inst,
about 5 on the outer and about 14 on the 10001 claw3 in Thanatus oblon-
9113 about 3 011 1110 011101· and about 10 on the inner; but in Th. formicinus
about 5 on the outer and 8 on 1110 101101. The number 01 100111 011 1110
claws is here, as usual, frequently very different not only on the different
pairs 01 legs of the same individual‚ but on the same pair in different in-
dividuals of the same species, and accordingly the number observed by 100
111 1110 various specimens that I have examined, frequently differs considerably
from that given by OHLERT.
