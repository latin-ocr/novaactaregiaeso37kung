divided⁷ or else to break up Thomz‘sus O. KOCH into some few minor ge-
nera. 1, for my part, have preferred the latter alternative. SIMON1) has
already divided Thomisus O. KOCH‚ S1M., into 4 '’sub-genera⁷'‚ Phloeoides,
leomisus‚ Pachyptz'la and ὁζῑχψιαηηαΙ and the sub-genus 'Hromz‘sus again into
three ⁷⁷g1·0ups⁷'‚ T lzomisus, Cirrofera (z Platychomisus DOLESCHALL 2) saltem Ι
ad partem) and Diana, and has furthermore proposed the new genera Oxy-
ptz'la and Plzrynoz‘des (Phryozarachne NOB.: vid. sup. p. 37). The last-named
(exotio) genus appears to me to merit preservation, but the other, European,
groups, to which he has assigned gencric names, Ι cannot, in the very
vague limits of SIMON'S definitions‚ accept as genera.

Type: lllom‘eses paradooeus (LUC.).

The genus Monastes —- or Monaeses, as I have called it, the name
M'mmstes being already appropriated (vid. p. 37) — was formed by LUCAS
for two remarkable Thomisinae from rugel-ia, and has lately been increased
by SIMON with a third and European species, Thomz‘sus Pioolmrdi SIM. from
Spain. As a fourth species I refer to this genus Aszcz'cus cmzeolus C. KOCH‚
which also belongs to the Fauna of Europe. SIMON in the latter of his works
above cited has suppressed this genus and united it with Thomisus, which
appears to us by no means a happy step. On this subject se farther p. 172.

The genus Sylvia NIC.3) seems to me, judging from the figures, to
be nearly related to, perhaps identical with Momses, although the species
of that genus are said not to be laterigrade, and to have vertical mandi-
bles. — Sylvz'a is the old Linnaean name of a genus of birds.

In All. cmzeolus the tarsal claws present very nearly the same con-
struction as in Mismnena and Dicea: the inner claw has about 12 long,
