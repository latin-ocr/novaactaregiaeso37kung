We preserve VVALCKENAER’S generic name leomz'sus for the large
and remarkable speeies, which WVALCKENAER called Th. abbreviatus ancl HAHN
Th. diadema, and which also in the works of O. KOCH retains the generic
name Thomz'sus. — By its high and sloping clypeus and its soniewhat pro-
truded mandimes, this spider, like the species of Monteses, in some degree
resembles the Philodrominae, but the entire general appearance of the ani-
mal, as well as the presence of the characters that distinguish the sub-family
Thomisinae‚ gives it an undoubted place in the last named group.

The tarsal claws of Th. abbreviatus Q are small, but coaise, not so
blunt however as those of Χμετὶσῑιε, with about 8 tolerably long, somewhat
curved comb-teeth on the inner and 4 on the outer claw. The female's
palpal claw is almost straight throughout half its length, then sharply curv-
ed⁷ with a long point and about 5 long comb-teeth, of which that nearest
the base is considerably sinaller than the rest.
