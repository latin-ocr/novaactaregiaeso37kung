lulismnena LATR. 1804 15, 35 we already know, synonymous with
Thomz'sus WALCK. 1805 ad part„ and accordingly has the right of priority
in preference to that later name. As LATREILLE loc. cit. names Aranea
citrea DE GEER (Aram. vatius OLERCK) as the type of lfflsumena, this oldest
generic name must be reserved for that oue of the smaller genera, into
which Misumena or Thomisus has by later authors been 1·esolved‚ that in-
cludes Ar. vatius CLERCK. To fllisumem, besides Ar. vatius, I reekon
among others Ar. trzmeata PALL. (horrida FABR.)‚ T hom. lateralis C. KOCH,
as also Thom. villosus LATR.‚ for which SIMON has formed the sub-genus
Paclzyptz'la. In order that the generally known name lemisus may not
116 altogether 1051, Ι have preserved it for a genus formed by myself, of
which the type is Thomz'sus abbreviatus WALCK. See preceding genus

The spiders belonging to this genus, which are usually referred 10
the same genus (leomz'sus C. KOCH) as Misumena vatia (CLERCK)‚· differ
from that and fron] other speeies of Allisumena by having the anterior row
of eyes less curved than the posterior, as also the anterior lateral eyes evi-
dently larger than the anterior central ones. In that respect they more
nearly approach Xysticus 111311 Misumena, which latter genus however they most
closely resemble in their weak extremities, armed with fine spines, and
their usually lively colours. This genus appears very nearly to coincide
with the '⁷g1·oup'⁷ Diana of SIMON⁷S leomisus; but 1116 name given by SI-
MON being previously engaged (vid. p. 36), I have replaced it with Dim.-
Ar. ylobosa FABR.‚ which appears to he the type of the sub-genus Syncema
SIM., may, although in its appearance tolerably different from Diaea dor-
seta, D. m‘z'cuspz'clata (lem. Diana WALoK.) ete„ perhaps for the present
be united with Dicea.
