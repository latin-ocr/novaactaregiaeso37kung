The genus Omyptila S1M., formed for leomz'sus clamatus VVALCK,
appears to me to differ fron] Atesstz'cns only by the bristles on the body being
incrassated at the extremity3- this is also the case in leom. scabriculus
WESTR.‚ which species Ι cannot generically distinguish from e. g. Aszt.
ὂνευίμεε, 111 which the bristles display, though in a less degree than 111 Th..
clamatus and scabriculus, a tcndency to become thicker towards the end.
The name Ooeyptz'la can moreover hardly be retained, on account of its
signification (from ὀξύς, sharp and πτίλον, bristle), which is absolutely the
reverse of the characteristic feature (the club-like thickening of the bristles
towards the apex) which seems to constitute the principal claim of this group
to be considered as a separate genus.

In the genus Asztz'cus the tarsal claws are very different in the two
sexes. In X. cristatus for ex. they are 111 the female short and strong,
pretty regularly curved, with 4 or ἱ) strong comb-teeth and frequently also
a finer tooth near the base. In the male the claws are weaker, rather long
and slender: they are but slightly curved for the greatest part of their length,
almost straight, with the point turned downwards3 the outer claw has about 5
sparse and coarse tecth3 on the inner claw the teeth are more numerous,
for where 111 the outer claw the inmost tooth is posited, we find 111 the in-
ner a group of about 5 closely set, fine tceth.

 

1) Aranea viatica LINN. or A. cristatus Cnmecrs, Which C. Kocn considers to 116
the same as his Xysticus viations, is an entirely different species, and = Αἵ caulam
C. KOCH. — In both species the genital bulb is on the underside, nearer the
base, provided with two processes: 111 X. cristatus that nearest the base is broad,
compressed, claw—like, the other is slender and has almost the form of a J, or an
anchon- in X. Κοσῆἱὶ, both processes are slender and of about the same substance:
that nearest the base is bent almost 111 the form of a boot, the other process has its
·short, hlzmt extremity curved against the foot of the boot. —— X. Kochiz' has not as
yet been found in Sweden.
