That 1110 spider C. KOCH has in the above cited passage of ”Die
Arachniden⁷' described under the name of Asztz'cus desiqaresszcs, cannot perma-
nently be considered as belonging to the genus A'ysticuffi he has himself
seen, and has accordingly in Uebers. d. Araclln.—Syst., 5, loc. cit. moved it
to his Thomisus. But that he is still dissatisfied with the position he has
thus assigned to this remarkable specieS, appears from his appending the
remark: ”Allan Formen nach eine ez'yene Gattzcny.'⁷ In fact this spider,
which in the particularly depresscd form of its body resembles certain spe-
cies of Delma and Herem-poda, must be considered as the type of a spe-
cial genus, the nearest neighbour to Asztsicns, but distinguished from that
genus, not only by its flattened body, but by having the anterior row of
eyes straight, while the posterior row is sensibly curved backward. — The
claws have much the same appearance as those of Xysticns.

All that is known about this remarkable genus is contained in the
following lines. ''Lastly I mention here a spider, Which I look upon as
new both as to genus and specles, and which Ι shall call Anetes coeletron.
Eyes posited as in Epeira. Abdomen oblong 11eart-f0rmed‚flat‚ terminating
in a hard point posteriorly3 on the underside of the belly a triangular,

any spinners. Tarsi destitute of claws. Length about 2 lines. Cephalo-
