thora-x brownish, abdomen white, densely sprinkled with dark-brown points.
Legs yellowish-white, mottled with brown. Lives in decaying matter. Un-
fortunately I possess no more than one female specimen. Appears to be
nearly related to Arkys lancearius &VALCIL Apt., Ι, 497, pl. 13, Fig. 3.”

This perfectly natural and universally acknowledged group, almost
identical With WALoKENAER’s ''Coureuses⁷⁷ and SIMON’S ''Lycosz'sbrmes⁷', and
characterised by its high, almost prismatic cephalothorax‚ with narrow back,
its eyes, which are arranged in 3 or 4 transversa] rows (rarely in 2, and,
when 50, the posterior row strongly curved backwards), its 3 tarsal claws,
its wandering habits, etc.‚ has but few points of connexion with other sub-
orders. The Lycosoz'clre however show (through Dolomecles) a relationship
with the Afflclewoz'dce (Texz‘rim) and Drassoz'doe (Zara), but may, as far at
least as regards the European forms, be easily distinguished from them by
differences in the form of the cephalothorax, as also by the the position of
the spinning tubes on the spinners‚ or by the number of the claws. They
also show a certain affinity to the Hersiliozdaffi but these are without diffi-
culty distinguished by their long superior spinnerS, garnished with spinning
tubes all along the under side, by the form of the parts of the mouth, etc.

link between the Lycosoz'cloe and the T heraphosoz'cloe ¹). The Otvyopoz'dce show
evident analogies with the Azsstoz'cloe,¹ both the Ooeyopoidce and Ocyale resemble

holes or gallcries in the ground: HENTZ (Aran. of the United States, in Bost Journ.
of Nat. Hist., IV, p. 220) even states that he once found such a hole, in the winter,
which was supplied with a lid. Also of the European Tarentula Apulia> it has
been said that it eloses the orifice of its gallery for hibernation3 but this is an error:
