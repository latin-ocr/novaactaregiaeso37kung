ference in the form of the claws between any of these Citigradae on the
one side and the Plziloclrominoe aud Actoidoe on the other is still greater.

SIMON divides his '’Lycosg'f'ormeffi into 3 tribus, Herse'lz'eozs, Lyconem,
and Dolome'dz'ens. The first of these answers to our Hersilz'm'doe, which ap-
pear to us to belong to the sub-order Tabitelarz‘oe, and not to the Citigradae.
The other two, which are distinguished, the ''Lycosz'ens” by having ''yeux
inegaux‚ corps court et ramasse, membres robustes et courts⁷'‚ whereas the
'’Dolome‘diens⁷' have ⁷'yeux peu inegaUX, corps etroit et allongfz, membres
fins, longs et allonges''‚ I cannot consider even as sub-families, for these
characteristics do not appear to me to hold good: Dolomedes for example
cannot surely be said to have a slenderer body and finer cxtremities than e. g.
Lycom. Omgsopes LATR. on the other hand is already by the position of the
eyes so distinctly separated from other C‘itsz'gyawadte, that that genus may rea-
sonably be considered as the type of a separate family.

We accordingly divide the European Citigyradoe into two families,
Lycosoidae aud anopoidce, in the following manner:

1. Oculi in series transversas tres vel duas dispositi: oculi 4 posteriores in tra-
pezium posticc latius, vel in lineam fortiter recurvam dispositi. I. Lycosoidoe.

2. Oculi in series transversas quattuor vel tres dispositi3 oculi 4 posteriores in
trapezium postice angustius vel in seriem procurvam dispositi. ΙΙ. Oxyopoz'doe.

Fam. Ι. LYCOSOIDAE.

Sym: 1533. Lycosides SUND.⁹ Consp. Arachn„ p. ‘23 (ad mam. φανὰ).

In this family we include all genera belonging to the Citiyradce, with
the exception of Oassgsopes LATR. or Splzasus WALCK. and Pasithea BLACKW.
or Pena-ecia NOB. — The claws in this family are very nearly similar to
those of the Agyalenoicloe: the superior tarsal claws are strong, broad at the
base, pectinated; the inferior claw is bent suddenly downwands⁷ but, unlike what
is usually the case with the Agaleuofflae, is generally toothless3 occasionally
it is furnished with one or two pointed teeth. The palpal claw of the
female is also pectinated, but has usually only a few teeth. In C? of many
speeies, especially within the genera Lycosa and Trochosa, the palpus is,
as OHLERT has shown 1), provided at the extremity with an appendage more
or less resembling a claw, which however can only be considered as a
coarse spine7 in as much as that it is not, like a real claw⁷ broader at
