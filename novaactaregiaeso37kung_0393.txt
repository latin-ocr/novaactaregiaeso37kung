As regards Limom'a [Leimom‘a] O. Koen, the pecularities in the form
of the head and position of the eyes of this sub—gcnus do not appear to us
of sufficient importanee to require a gcnerie separation froin Pardosa or
Lycosa, and we therefore give to the last named genus 1116 compass as-
signed by SUNDEVALL iu the Consp. Arachn. to his sub-gcnus Lycosa. The
differcnce in the habits of Pam-losa and Limum, mentioned by O. KOCH,
is not universal, for 6. g. L. [ismariov (CLERCK), which is evidenly a Limenia,
lives 111 dry, sunny places (especially 111 111116-1100116), 1101 111 wet localities.
In the structure of the claws there is no diffcrence: also the form of the
cocoon is the same 111 Parc-losa and Limom'a. — The name Leimom'a had
already in 181ss been given hy HUBNER to a genus of Lepidoptera.

BLAGKWALL and WEsrRING preserve WALCKENAER'S Lysa-osa undividcd7
and 11 must 116 admitted, that the characteristic distinctions, 011 1116 strength
of which it. has by some modern araehnologists been divided into several
genera, are hy no means so sharp as could 116 desired. They show 1116111-
661166 111016 111 1116 animals’ habits, in the form given to 111611· 60600116, and
in the disposition of the colours7 than in distinctly marked differences in the
form of the various parts of the body.

The superior tarsal claws in Lycosa have ordinarily from 5 to 7
coarse, thinly set, somewhat divergent teeth3 the inferior claw is usually
unarmed, 11111, according to OHLEm‘, is now and 111611 provided with a very

small tooth. In the species examincd by 1116 1116 palpal claw is furnished
with two or three eoarse teeth.
