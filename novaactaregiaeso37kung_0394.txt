4 teeth. In the large burrowing species, 6. g. T. melanogyaster (LATR.) or
Narbonensis (XVALCKJQ the free point of the claw is longer and bent more
deeply downward than in the smaller species found in north and 661111311Εο-
rope. In T. melanoyaster, the palpal claw has 4, the superior tarsal claws
5 or (3 teeth in the first half of their length. Also in T. Apulae these
latter claws are armed with 5 strong comb—teeth, according to BERGSoE ¹).

Ι have not been able to discover any feature depending 011 difference
of form, whereby Aretosa O. KOCH may with certainty be distinguished from
Trochosci. 1D., and I therefore follow SIMON 111 uniting these two genera in
one, under the latter name. A differenee might perhaps be shown to exist
in the forn] of the claws, but it does not appear to me advisable to found
a genus 011 a characteristic, that can only be discerned by the aid of the
microscope. In the species of Arctosoe that I have had the opportunity of
examining (A. cinerea C. KOCH, A. pieta 1D., Lyso. leopardus SUND.), the superior
tarsal and the palpal claws have their toothless extremity considerably longer,
and cui-ved more deeply downwards, than 111 most other Lycosoidae, at least
011 the fore legs: the superior tarsal claws are provided with teeth through-
out their first half only, and on the palpa] claw the teeth are seated still
nearer the base. This form of the claws is, Ι suppose, connected with
these spiders' more fully developed ability of digging themselves cylindrical
holes or galleries 111 the earth. (00111ι preceding genus, Tarentum). In T.
(A.) cinerea Ι have met with about 10 teeth on the superior tarsa} elaws
of the 1³¹, and 12 011 the 4t¹¹ pair of legs, those most external being bent
somewhat foi-ward, all of about equa] length, the inferior claw is small and
