destitute of teeth3 the palpal claw has 3 or 4 small comb-teeth close to
the base. In T. (A.) picta the claws are somewhat shorter, with about 8
teeth 011 the superior tarsa] claws, in T (A.) leopardus with 7: in this last
species I have seen one tooth 011 the inferior claw‚ and a very small point
just behind it, at least on the 41¹¹ pair of legs. — Also in T. intricaria C.
KOCH the free extremity of the claws is very long3 the superior tarsal claws
have but 4 parallel teeth‚ of which the three outer are very coarse3 the palpal
claw has also 4 teeth‚ the innermost much smaller than the others. This
speeies is also distinguished by the trapezoid formed by the 4 posterior
eyes being twice as broad behind as in from, whereas in the typical spe-
cies of the genus it is only 1ss time as broad behind: moreover the anterior
row of eyes is longer in comparison with the middle row than in the other
species of the genus. But it does not appear to me necessary on account
of these deviations to form a new genus for T. intricaria.

T. ruricola has 5-ss comb-teeth on the superior tarsal claws3 the
inferior claw is without teeth; the palpal claW has four gradually increasing
teeth. In this species the spine, which is so frequently met with among the
Lycosoidae at the end of the male's palpus, is pointed and somewhat curved
at the extremity, and thus very like a toothless claw3 it is absent in T.
terricola THOR.‚ in which speeies the female’s palpa] claw is generally
furnished with 2 coarse teeth‚ and a 3¹1¹ small tooth behind them.

Type: Pirata piraticus (CLERCK).

The name Pirata SUND. has right of priority in preference to Po-
tamia O. ΚΟΟΗ, which latter moreover had been already several times ap-
propriated‚ before KOCH in 1848 applied it to the genus before us.—Vid. p. 37.

P. piraticus has about 7 long teeth on the superior tarsa] claws‚ and
one fine tooth with the rudiment of a second on the inferior claw. The
