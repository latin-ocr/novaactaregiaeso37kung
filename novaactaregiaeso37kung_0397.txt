ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERs. 195

This genus, which BLACKWALL, following WALCKENAER, has united
with Dolonzedes, differs even in the whole of its general appearance from
the preceding genera, which are more typical of the family. — On the first
pair of legs the superior tarsal claws are armcd with about 12 teeth, the
inferior with one tooth; on the 4⁸¹ pair there are about 9 tceth on the su-
perior and two on the inferior claw, and of these last the foremost is rather
long and curved, the back tooth small. The palpal claw is strong, with
about 7 teeth gradually increasing in length.

This genus was originally formed by WALOKENAER for the species
we have adduced as its type. To it he afterwards referred — according
to a figure and short notice, left by the painter OUDINOT, and representing
a spider found by him near Paris — the species O. Onclz'notiz' WALCK.
XVALOKENAER had however not himself seen this spider, and no Crenas has
since been met with in France, so that one may reasonably doubt whether
O. Otadinotz'z· be really a Ctenus. WALCKENAER also considered a spider
described and figured by ALBIN (Nat. Hist. of Spid, p. 51, Pl. XXXIV,
F ig. 167 1)) as belonging to this genus, probably on the strength of a certain
similitude in the position of the eyes (which iu ALBIN'S figure are arranged
in 2 lines, the first consisting of 2, the other, which is much curved back-
wards, of 6 eyes)3 but ALBIN's figures, perhaps more especially those which
represent the positions of the eyes, are in general so faulty, that it is im-
possible to place any confidenee in them, and I am the less inclined t0
believe that the figure in question really represents a crenus, since sub-
sequent English arachnologists have never found any species of that genus
in their country. It appears therefore to me more than doubtful that the
genus Ctemcs is anywhere represented in the Fauna of Europe]

1) This figure probably represents a leanatzcs oblongus (WALCK.).
