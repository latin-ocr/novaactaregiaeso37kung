Fam. Π. OXYOPOIDAE.

The spiders of this family, as is known, exhibit certain analogies
with both Attoz'dce and Philodrominoe‚ and seem to form a connecting link
between the Lycosoidoe and these groups. They resemble the Attoz'dce in
their, comparatively with the Lycosoidae, broader back of the cephalothorax,
and frequently display a remarkable similitude with the Philodromince in their
whole general appearance, and even in the position of the eyes (compare
e. g. Peucetia and Erz'pus). But the Lycosoz'dce are, as is generally admitted,
their nearest relations, and it is also with them that they most closely agree
in the structure of the claws. The tarsal claws are however usually longer
than in the Lycosoidae, with a shorter extreniity and more teeth; the inferior
claw has, in the species that I have examined, two or three tecth. The males
have no claw at the end of the palpus. — To this family I refer two Eu-
l'opean genera, Pezccetz‘a and Ooeyopes.

Type: Pezccetz'a viridis (BLACKW.).

The type of this genus is Omyopes littoralis SIM. (loc. cit), but this
species appears to me to be identical with Pasithea viridis BLACKW. (loc.
cit), which was first by BLAOKWALL aggregated to the Lateri9⁷⁴adae, but
afterwards ¹) rightly to the Citiyradoe. — P. viridis differs from Oxyoms,
to which genus it is referred by SIMON, not only in the position of the eyes,
