ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 197

but also by its long, slender maxillae ‹lilated at the baso, etc. The supe-
rior spinners are distinctly longer than the inferior. The claws are more
powerful than in the genus Gaulopes: the superior tarsal claws have only
about 7 long, strong, pointed comb-teeth, and the inferior has three, of
which the outermost two arc long and curved. —— Of this handsome spider,
which has been found in Algeria and Spain, I am acquainted only with
the male, of which Mr. SIMON kiudly sent me a specimen. The name Pa-
sithea being already appropriated, Ι have substitutcd a new (vid. p. 36, 37).

Type: Omyopes variegyatus LATR.

On the upper tarsal claws of Ο. variegatus I have counted, on the
outer about 17, and on the inner about 14, long, fine, close, parallel comb-
teeth; the inferior olaw terminates in a long, fine, straight point, and has
two fine, long, curves] teeth at the base. The palpal claw is small, with
10 close-set, fine comb-teeth. O. italicus has but about 10 teeth on the su-
perior tarsal claws, ou the inferior claw it has two powerful, curved teeth,
and on the palpal claw about 8 long teeth.

The Brazilian genus Iclz‘ops PERTY 1) is by WALCKENAER 2) taken up
as synonymous with Splmsns or Omgsopes: it has, it is true, a certain re-
semblance to that genus 111 the position of the eyes; but the direction of
the mandibular claW, which is articulated Zonyituclinally, as in the Terri-
telarioe, appears to us to shOW, that Idiops belongs to that sub-order, to which
it is also referred by PERTY. The species described by him, Ι. fusca ³),
shows in the form of the male's palpi an evident analogy With the genus Acti-
ozopus PERTY among the Theraphosoz'dae, from which genus Idiops 111 other
respects would seem to be widely separated. The form of its cephalothorax
displays some resemblance to that of Filistata LATR.
