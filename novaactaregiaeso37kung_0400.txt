The spidcrs belonging to this group are, as is known, distinguished
by their high cephalothorax, which has almost vertical sides and a very
broad back⁷ by their usually short and thick extremities‚ aud by the pecu-
liar position of their eyes, which most nearly approaches that ot' the Lycosoidae:
4 eyes in fact form a first row⁷ and the remaining 4 a second and third.
An exception in the disposition of the eyes is presented by the exotic fa—
inily Offiofflzopoidoe, in which the eyes form only two transversal rows, con-
verging at the ends, aud by Lyssomsmes among the Attoz'cloe, which genus
has its eyes· arranged infour transversal rows. In the Myrmeeioidoe the eyes
may bc as truly said to form two rows divergent at the ends⁷ as threa- in
Palpimanus also they arc arranged in two rows, botlz greatly curved in op-
posite directions, so that one might even say that the eyes of that genus form
four rows. The family Dz'nopoz'dce‚ which we, though with doubt, refer to
this sub-order, differs especially in its very long and fine extremities from
other Saltigi-adae. Also in certain other genera, as for example Myrmecem,
Salticus and Leptorclzestes‚ the extremities are fine⁷ though somewhat short. —⁴
The spinum-s, as far as is known7 are six iu number, usually not very long.
There are generally but two claws on each tarsus, aud iu this case there
is also⁷ except in Palpimmws (and Otiotlzopff) a tuft of hairs dilated at the
end immediately under the claws3 Eresus (as well as Dinopz'sffi has 3 claws
ou each tarsus, as also a claw at the termination of the female’s palpus,
which is absent in at least Attoz‘doe and Pazpimavzinoe. Most Saltigiadae leap
actively, whence the name.

We resolve the European Saltigradae into two families, Eresoz‘doe and
Attoidoe, according to the following distinctive features:

1. Cephalothorax antice valde elevato-convexus. Oculi 2 postici inter se multo
longius distantes quam sunt duo proxime antecedentes. Tarsi unguibus trinis
aut binis instructi, fasciculo unguiculari carentes. . . . . . Ι. Eresoidoe.

2. Cephalothorax deplanatus, parte cephalica non vel paullo tantum altiore quam
parte thoraciea. Oculi 2 postici inter se non multo longius quam 2 antece-
