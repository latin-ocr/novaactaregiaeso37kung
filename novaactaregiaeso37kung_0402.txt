200 T. THORELL‚

Sub-fam. I. ERESINAE.

This sub-family includes for the present 2 genera, Eresus WALCK.
and Dorceus O. KOCH (exotio and distinguished by long, three-Jointed ma-
millae). C. KOCH has indeed divided Eri-esus into two genera, Erythrophora
and Eresus ¹), but as the genus Erythrophora can hardly be distinguished
from Eresus by anything else than a difference of colour, it seems to me
not deserving of preservation.

Gen. 1. ERESUS WALCK. 1805.
Derim: probably ἐρείδω, press against, inflict, attack.

Type: Eresus cinnabarim& (Onu).

In the few species of this genus known to me, the calamistrum is
but slightly developed. In a Ω of E. lineatus LATR. or E. acantliophz'lus DUF. 2),
which has the upperside of the two posterior metatarsi somewhat flattened,
the calamistrum is plainly visible on the external edge3 but in the male of
Ε. οἱηιηιόενὶη.ῑι3, in which these metatarsi are cylindrical as iu the other
legs, I cannot pereeive any calamistrum distinguishable from the adjacent
fine hair. The infra-mammillary organ is on the contrary easily seen in
both species: in E. lineatus it forms a very narr0W‚ uniformly broad, trans-
versal area, which appears to be divided into two by a middle suture, and
exhibits two rozmded fovece 3)7 one on each side, and a small depression
behind these, near the spinners.

The tarsal claws of Eresus are short, but extremely broad and strong,

2) This species was first described by LATREILLE in the ΞΜ Edition of Nouv.
Dict. d'Hist. Nat„ X, p. 393 —— which Ι have not been able to consult — under the
name of ''Ere'se rccye'” (see for inst. WALCK„ Ins. Apt., I, p. 399), probably also with
the Latin name Eresus lineatus.- at least it is by Aunonm, in Dict. class. d'Hist.
Nat„ VI, p. 253, called ''Eresus lineatas LATREILLE''.
