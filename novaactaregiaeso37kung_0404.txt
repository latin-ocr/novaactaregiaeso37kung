mis, that name not being unfit for the animal to which it has been applied,
and having been published long before the name Chersis.

The genus Palpimamcs is extremely interesting, not only 011 account
of the well known singular form of its first pair of legs, but also for cer-
tain characteristics, which mark it as a connecting-link between Eresinoe
and Attoidae. The agreement with these last in the absence of an infra-
mammillary organ and calamistrum, we have already mentioned: also the
close position of the 4 anterior eyes, of which the 2 central ones are larges
than the other G, shows a tendency to similitude to the Actoidae. The fe-
male's palpi are incrassated outwards, flattened on the underside, and, like
those of the last-mentioned spiders, destitute of a claw at the extremity.
In the Eresz‘noe, as we have already observed, the fasciculus unguicularis
or claw-tuft usually found in the Actoiclse, is wanting: it is also absent in
Pallraimsnmm but the peculiarly formed hairs of which it is composed are
found in that genus, though they have been transferred to another place.
The broad compressed metatarsus has 111 fact (in P. yibbzalus) both its su-
perior and inferior edge covered with hairs which rapidly dilate to oval or
spade-like blades, and a band of such hairs, enclosed by longer, pointed
bristles, is continued also along the upper edge of the tibia and patella.
These hairs are longer on the upper edge of the metatarsus, where they
are mixed with numerous longer, pointed bristles, than on its underside,
where they are closer, shorter and of uniform length, and where only a few
longer, pointed bristles occur, they accordingly here form a scopula, which
is continued under a part (the base) of the tarsus itself. This joint is else
only covered with pointed hairs and bristles.

The claws, as is known, are but 2 in number on the tarsi of the
six posterior legs. They are weaker than those of the Eresz'nOE, and stouter
than those of the Attoz'cloe. They are rather large, of uniform breadth, and
curved in the form of a semicircle3 the outer claw has (in P. yibbulus) on
the 4²1¹ pair of legs about 7 teeth, the 1111101· 6; 011 1110 2¹¹d and 3¹d pairs
the teeth are less numerous (5 and 4 on the 2¹¹d pair). These teeth are
conical, rather short and far apart. ⁷

According to DUFOUR’S frequently repeated statement, P. yibbulus
differs from all other spiders by having no claws οη the first pair of lays.
This is nevertheless so far from being the case, that this spider has really
no less than three claws on the first pair of lays, but only two οη the suo-
ceeclz‘nq pairs! In this respect Palpz'manus probably stands quite alone
in the order of spiders. The claws on the 1st pair are however so small
that they are quite concealed by the hairs at the extremity of the tarsus,
