and ean only be clearly scen with a good microscopc. The superior ones
are similar in form to those of the following legs, except that they are less
curved and have only about 3 conieal 166111, 1116 inferior claw has the form of a
very small hook, sharply bent downwards, with a long finc extremity, and
seems to be armcd 011 the underside with one long fine tooth. Thus the
number ot' claws on the first pair is the same as in Eresos, and 011 the
other legs as in the Actoisloe.

This family, perhaps the most sharply defined and most natural
within the whole order of Araneoe, is without difficulty distinguished from
the Eresoz'doe by the peculial· position and relative size of the eyes. The
6161115 6116 111 all cases only 1110 011 each tarsus ¹), they are long and slcnder,
a little sinuatecl (i. e. with a slight oe-formed curvature), and spring at a
right or slightly acute angle from the upper end of the narrow and high
part formed by their base. The tooth-armature is very various, and ordi-
1161111)Υ different on the inner and outer claw, the number of teeth on the
former being usually far greater than on the latter. The teeth, when there
are any, occupy only the outer half of the claw’s length3 near the base
there are no 166111, except now and then on the first pair of legs, the claws
of which 6116 often shorter and more uniformly curved than those of the
other legs. The 4²¹¹ pair of legs has usually the claws longest and most
copiously provided with teeth. The claxv-tuft is formed of hairs that are
either flattened and gradually more or less dilated towards the end, or di-
lated and flattened at the 6111611111)γ only3 in this respect the tufts on the
different pairs of legs are often very different, they are sometimes, on the
lst pair, continued as a scopula 011 1116 underside of the tarsus. In all the
species that have been examined, the female’s palpi are destitute of a ter-
minal claW, a circumstance, which in other families, with the exception of
the Scytodoz'doe, only occurs exceptionally. I believe it is only the species
of this family, that justify the name ⁷⁷ jumping-spiders⁷‘, given to the whole

1) Attus phrynoides WALCK. (Ins. Apt., I, p. 479) is said to have 011 115 extra-
ordinarily long lst pair of legs (pedes raptorii) only one toothless claw. This species
ought undoubtedly to form a separate genus, to which also Attus obisioz'des DOLESCH.
(Bijdr. t. d. Kenn. d. Arachn. v. d. Iud. Arch.‚ p. 433) ought to be referred. This
new genus, characterized by the long trochanteres of the fore-legs, may be called
Diolenz'us (διωλὲνιος, with outstretched arms).
