sub-order. — All the European speeies may be referred 10 0110 and the
same sub-family (Attimek among exotie forms perhaps Lyssomanes ΗΕΝΤΖ 1),
ought to be considered as the type of a separate sub-family, characterized
by the eyes being arranged in four transversal rows: the lateral eyes of
the first row in the ordinary Attoidae are in fact 111 Lyssomanes removed so
high up that they form a separate row about half-way between the first and
third pair of eyes. The relative size of the eyes is however exactly the
same in Lyssomanes as 111 1110 Attinae, i. e. the first pair is considerably
larger and thc third pair considerably less than the other eyes. (ln the
Dinopoz'clre, in which the position of the eyes is the sanie as in the Actiaca,
the relative size of the eyes is altogether different: it is in fact the last
pair but 0110, 01· 1110 eyes of the 2⁰⁶¹ row, which in that family are eonsi-
derably larger than the rest). — Calamistrum and infra-mammillary organ
are absent.

There is no family in the whole order of spiders, which, on account
of the great similarity between the species, is so difficult to resolve into
good genera, as this, while at the sametime its extraordinary richness in
speeies renders sueh a resolution in the highest degree desirable. In the
works of the older writers, from LATREILLE and WALCKENAER inclusively,
the whole family constitutes but 0110 genus, Saltieus LATR. or Actus WALCK.,
which by many arachnologists‚ among whom is BLACKWALL‚ is still pre—
served undivided. But already in 1832 HENTZ ²) detaehed from Attus WALCK.
the genus Synemosva, which partly answers to Leptorclzestes ΝΟΒ. or Sal-
tiens O. KOOH (non SUND.), as also Epibleimmz (ad part. = Callietlzera
C. Kocfi). SUNDEVALL 3), who is followed by WEsrfflNe, the following year
divided Attus WALCK. into two genera, Saltz'cns and Attus, which easily
admit of distinction. This on the contrary is not the ease with most of
the Attoid—genera proposed by O. KOCH (in Uebers. d. A1·aehn.-Syst.‚ Die
Araehniden⁷ ete.) between 1835 and 1850, and which have been pretty
generally received, 111 spite of the imperfect manner in which they have
been characterized. WVHITE in 1841 4) formed the genus Homalattus and in
184ss ⁵) Dinereszcs [Deineresus]‚ both exotio. OHLERT G) has endeavoured to
define more accurately those of KOCH'S genera, which belong to the Prus-
