sian Fanna; but his attcmpts do not appear to me to have fully sue-

SIMON in 1864 ¹) combined C. KoCI-l's many genera so as to formfive, Rha-
πίε O. Koen (= Rhene Tuon: Vid. p. 37), Attus WALCK.‚ (yrtonota
SIM., Helz‘olrwlzazms C. KOCH and Salticns (1111111.)Ἰ 01 which the last four be-
long to the I⁴¹auna of Europe: the greatest part of KOCH'S genera (and sub-
genera) SIMON accepted as separate sub-genera or ’'groups⁷'2). SIMON'S
classifieation of the Attoidae here referred to, appears to me very defective,
and can hardly be considered as making any advance towards the solution
of the diffieult problem3 the genus Curtonota, in which he includes KOCH'S
Callz'ethera together with Philia, Pleav'qus, ete. especially is very unnatural.
SIMON himself has lnoreover since abandoned this division and adopted another
quite different3 he now ³) divides the European Attoidae into 10 genera (01
which two, Memenmns and Yllenus, are new) according to characteristies
principally derived from the form qf the male’s palpi and mamlibles. This
division has indeed the advantage of being based upon fixed and easily
observable differences of form, but it has also the great defect of applying
only to one (and that the rarer) sex3 it is impossible to say to which of
SIMON'S genera a female specimen belongs, as long as the male of 1116 5111116
species is unknown, unless it should happen, that the females of that genus
are also distinguished by some common feature3 but in such case that
feature ought 10 have been included among the characteristics of the genus.
Ι have already (p. 19, 83> stated my objections to the adoption of genera
depending upon characteristies that apply only to one sex⁷ or that are de-
rived from a difference of form in the organs of eopulation alone.

What has here been said, sufficiently indicates my opinion, that a
natural arrangement of the Attoidae is as yet a pium desiderium. For my
own part Ι have awhile hesitated between two methods of proceeding —
either to adopt only three genera, Saltz'cus (Pyroplzorus O. ΚΟΟΗ), Leptor-
chastes (Salticus O. KOOH) and Ami& -—— or to adopt and endeavour as well
as possible to characterize those of the genera formed by O. KOCH‚ which
belong to the European Fauna. These genera are in fact pretty well known
as regards their general appearance, and they have also been acknowledged

SIMON also refers to the Attoidae, is in our opinion the type osa separate family,

of Attus (loc. eit., p. 316).
