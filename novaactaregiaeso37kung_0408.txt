by several arachnologists. They moreover 011 the whole form tolerably na-
tural groups, although KOCH has not succeeded in giving any reliable dia-
gnosis of them. Ι have determined on adopting the second, far more dif-
ficult alternative, because I believe the division of the genus Attus XVALCK.
into several smallcr genera to be a matter of great practical importance,
especially on account of the great number of exotic species that have been
described, and which furnish an amount of materials which it will be scar-
cely possible to manage, unless one can distribute them among smaller
generic groups. I am however by 110 means satisfied with the result of the
experiment I have made, and the following arrangement, of the many de-
fects of which I am perfectly conscious, must therefore be looked upon as
merely provisional. It may however possibly, even if but negatively, con-
tribute iu some measure to the solution of the problem. None but a person
having at his disposal far more comprehensive materials for research than
I can command, can hope to arrive at any fully satisfactory result.

All O. KOCH'S European genera have been here employed, with the
exception of Icelus 1)7 which is founded on a feature (the back of the man-
dibles raised to a sharp ridge) belonging only to one seX, the males. Two
of his sub-genera, Ballus and Dia (AElnrops non.) have been promoted to
the rank of genera, the others 1 have been obliged to pass by. Ι have
also endeavoured to give a place in my scheme to the genera Alsenemerus
and Yllemcs formed by SIMON.

2) In order to jndge rightly of the eyes' distance from the edge of the clypeus
and of the form of the latter, it is necessary to remove at least a part of the thick
eovering of hair which ordinarily conceals the edge: morcover the memhrane, which
unites the base of the mandibles, and which is sometimes covered With hair, and
frequently visible under the edge of the clypeus, must not be reckoned as part of
the clypeus.
