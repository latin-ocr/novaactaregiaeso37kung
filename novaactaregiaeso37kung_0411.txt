XVhen SUNDEVALL in 1833 (loc. cit.) divided Salticus LATR. or Attus
WVALCK. into two genera, Salat-us and Attus, it was for a speeies of 1110
genus afterwards by C. KOCH called Pyroplzorus‚ that he preserved the for-
mer, older 1101110, and 1101 for a Saltz'czes O. ΚΟΟΗ, 111111οΙ1 genus was to him
unknown. This appears immediately from the description of SUNDEVALL'S
Salcz'cus formicwins, the (φ of which has the mandibles ”fere porrectae, supra

lica abrupte altior qnam diomedea,- . . . oculi. . . aream quadratam . . . delinean-
teffi) is suitable only to Pyrophorzzs, and not to Salticus KOCH‚ and this last
genus cannot therefore be considered as corresponding to Salcicus SUND.
