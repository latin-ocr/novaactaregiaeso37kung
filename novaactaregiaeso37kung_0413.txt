ΟΝ EUROPEAN spumas. 211

”nearly horizontal‚ slender, as long as the eephalothorax, tooth as long.''
Of the two speeies adduced, Ε. faustum and E. palmarum, the first-named
is made type of the new genus. But that E. fariseam is so extremely like
our European Callietlzera histrionz'ca O. KOCH and C. scenica, that I imagine
it to be identical with one 01· other of them ¹), and they must accordingly
resign their generic name Calliethera for the older name Epiblemum. —- E.
palmarum is perhaps a Pleoez’ppus O. ΚΟΟΗ, and certainly does not belong
to the same genus as E. faustum.

SIMON refers 10 Calliethera also for inst. the species O. infimafius]
Suu„ which its whole appearance, the spines on its legs, etc. indicate in my
opinion to belong to Helioplmnus O. KOCH.

The male Epiblemum, like the male Salmas, is distinguished byits
almost horizontal, projecting mandibles. —— The eyes of the 3¹⁴³ row are
farther from each other than from the margin of the eephalothorax. The
elaws are very long and sle11der, and the teeth on the inner elaw very nu-
merous (about 15 in E. histrionicam on the 4¹¹¹ pair), on the outer claw on the
contrary few (in the above named speeies about 3); the number is however
very variable. The hairs of the claw-tufts are gradually somewhat dilated.

The males of this genus, which is easily recognized by its general
appearance, are usually distinguished, as KOCH has already remarked, by

(Boston Journ. of Nat. Hist.‚ V, p. 367, Pl. XXII, fig. 17). — BLACKWALL‚ who does
not consider E. histrionicum as speeifieally different from E. scenicum, includes ’'Sal-
tiens „scenicus” in a catalogue of spiders from Canada. (Notice of Spid. capt. by Po'rTER

in Canada, p. 34).
