212 T. THORELL‚

a strong tooth 011 the underside of the pars femoralis of the palpus. In
some speeies the cephalothorax is not double as long as it is broad, but
it is easy to distinguish them from other, nearly related genera by the close-
ness of the anterior central eyes and their inconsiderable distance from the
deeply emarginated edge of the almost naked clypeus, together with the
peculial· colour (black, abdomen more or less metallie, legs generally yellow
or spotted with yellow). The eyes of the 3‘s1 row are usually, but not al-
ways, more widely separated from each other than from the margin of the
cephalothorax. The elaws are of the usual form, nearly similar to those
of Effiwaww, but the teeth are less numerous 011 the inner claw. In
H. cupreus I have counted 6 fine tceth upon the inner and 2 coarse ones
on the outer claw (ΛΨ pair). OHLERT states the numbers to be 10 and 1.
On the 1st and ΒΜ pair, according to him, the external claw is without
teeth. The hairs of the claw-tuft dilate gradually outwards.

Type: Ballus heteroplzthalmus (REUSS).

To this genus we refer not only the species proposed as its type,
but also Attus depressus WALCK. (Salticus brevz'pes HAHN), Which C. KOCH
refers to Illarpesm, and Salticzzs obscurus BLACKW.⁷ Which is probably
nothing else than the male of Ballus depressus.

The claws are, at least 111 Β. depressus, small, slightly sinuated, of
ordinary form: on the 4³¹¹ pair I have eounted about 15 teeth on the 1111161·
and about 5 on the outer claw3 the outer claw of the 1St pair is destitute
of teeth, the inner has about 10 teeth. The hairs of the claw-tuft are
dilated at the extremity.
