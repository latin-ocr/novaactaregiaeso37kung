we assign to this genus ''e'lmyi en p‹1lette‚⁷' as 111 1110 typica] species, which
feature SIMON however takes as characteristic of the genus. As we have
above defined it, it includes among the Attoidae with which Ι am acquainted,
not only M. muscosa, M. radiata (GRUBE) and M. hamata C. KOCH 1)⁷ but
also Salticus pulchellus HAHN, AIIenemerus falszflcus SIM. and Attus Lucasiz'
81111, which last-mentioned two species, together with several other European
Attoidae, SIMON himself had the kindness to 501111 me. In its general ap-
pearance this genus 0001111105 a place between Epiblemum and flleozemerus.
M. pulchella (HAHN) seems to form a transition to the former genus. Con-
cerning Icelus O. KOCH 500 p. 206. — The claws are somewhat shorter
and stronger than in most other Atcoidoe, at least in M. muscosa, in which
51100105 Ι have counted about 15 fine teeth on the 1111101, and from 3 to 6
011 the outer claw.

1) Icelus notabilis O. Kocfl is the male to his Marpessa hamata; both are stated
to be from Naples. I have myself captured them in Rome. SIMON has obligingly
sent me both 0²³ and Q under the name of Attus striatas WALCK. (Attus striatas
(CLERCK) 15 (111110 another spider). Marpessa hamata SlM. is not identical with C.

Kocff‘s spider of that name.
