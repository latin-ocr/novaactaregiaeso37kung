uitalis) ἀ dc'couvert sons lez-jambffl' (pars tibialis), as distingnishing it from
Attus, Marpessa, Yllevms and others, which have the ”dama enveloppe' en
(lessus par le tarse’' (lamina bulbi or pars tarsalis). The specics of SIMON'S
Dendrgsplzantes known to mc (among which I have however ncver met with
the fnllgrown 0³), name-ly D. yestienlator SIM. and D. clm-satus C. KOCH 1),
belong to Attus according to our definition of that genus. OHLERT had al-
ready previously to SIMON defined the genus Dendryphantes so that D. luz-
status must be considered as its type, and this determination, which we
adopt, thus has the right of priority in preference to that which SIMON has
made for the genus.

The claws are of the ordinary form, little sinuated, with numerous
teeth on the inner elaw. In D. hastatus on the Ft pair of legs I have
counted above 20 close-set, very fine eomb-teeth‚ bnt only 4 coarse and
distant teeth on the outer claw. In another specimen the inner claw of the
4ῈΙΙ pair had about 18, the outer about 7 teeth. The hairs of the claw-tnfts
are slightly dilated at the extreme apex.

1) In specimenS‚ which Ι look upon as yozmy males of this species, not only is
the short tibial joint of the palpus, but also its long tarsaljoint enlarged and broader
than the preceding joints3 the inferior and exterior part of the tibial joint is swelled,
but shows no separate bulbus -— all just as in the figures ofD. bilineatus(WA12011.),
which SIMON has given loc. cit, Pl. II (VI), fig. 13a, and which therefore appear
to me to represent the palpus of a not yet fully developed male. In 0⁷* ad., accord-
ing to SmoN, the tarsal joint is alike in both sexes, small and cylindrical, only a
little longer in the male, whose tibial joint is on the underside incrassated and hol-
lowed out, and contains the balbas 9enitalis(‘?). Such a relation would ind-ced, as
SIMON rightly observes, distinguish these spiders from the other species of the fa-
mily3 it would even separate their from all other spiders, for, as far as we know,
the bulbus genitalis in all other cases belongs to the tarsal and not to the tibial
joint. -— Also in the younger males of some other Attoidae, e. g. fisenemerus semi-
limbatus or viyoratus, the palpus has a form like that in the above described speeies
of Dendryphantes Sum: the tibial joint is very short and only indistinctly sepa-
rated from the long palpal joint: both these joint-s are broader than the preceding,
and the tibial joint incrassated on the underside. Ι suspect that the bulbus genita—
lis is here formed within the two last joints of the palpus, though, when freed at
the last change of the integument, it adheres to the tarsal joint.
