Type: Euopltrys frontalis (WALCK.).

When O. KOCH in 1833, 111 HERR.-SCHAEFF., Deutschl. Ins, N:o 119,
for the first time mentioned an Attus, it was A. terebratus (CLERCK) that
he described under that name. In the same work he, in 1834, described,
under the new generic name EuoplzryS, two species, which 118 called E.
festiva and E frontalis. Somewhat later (1837), in Uebers. d. Arachn-
Syst, 1, he endeavoured to give the characteristics which distingnish Attus
and Euophrys: 118 111818 registered, as belonging to Attus, A. arcuatus
(CLERCK)‚ as also A. terebratus (ID), the position of the eyes and the male's
palpi of which he figured, and which species therefore ought to be con-
sidered as 1116 type of the genus. To Euopltrys he refers several 61166186,
which are very nearly related to A. terebratus and arcuatus, but moreover
also e. g. E. petretzsz‘S, which is more nearly related to Ε. frontalis. This
latter species is now not mentioned, neither 16 Ε. festiva. Several years
later, in Die Araehniden XIII and XIV (1846, 1848), 1118 find that KOOH
has completely altered 1116 view of the genera Attus and Euopltrys: A. tere-
bratus and A. arcuatus are now referred to Euopltrys‚ whereas E. frontalis
and E. petrensis are aggregated to Attus. So also lastly in Uebers. d.
Arachn.-Syst., 5 (1850). From what has now been said it is evident‚ that
KooH at different times has defined the genera Attus and Euopltrys in to-
tally different and irreconcileable ways. As he in 1837, when WALOKE-
NAER’S great genus Attus was broken up by him, defined the genus, for
which he preserved WALCKENAER’S name, so, that A. terebratus was to be
the type for Attus (WALCK.) KoCH, it is clear, that the name Euoplzrys, if
not to be absolutely cashiered, must be applied to some one or more of the
species described under that name, which can not be referred 10 1116 661116
genus as A. terebratus, and preferentially to that species among them, which
was first described under the name Euoplmys: accordingly to E. frontalis.
(The contemporaneonsly described E. festiva = E. striata KOCH [non CLERCK]
is an Attus (WALGK.) NOB.). — Euopltrys (KOCH) NOB. must accordingly be
Ξ sub—gen. Attus KOCH 1850.

Like Attus, the species of Euopltrys have a high cephalothorax, but
as the back of the eephalothorax 16 66 broad as its base, and the hinder-
