most eyes, are situated near the side-edges of the back, the distance be-
tween them is greater 01· at least not less than that between the eye and
the bordei· of the cephalothorax (which does not gradually diminish in breadth
towards the frent). The eye-area occupies a larger proportion of the ce-
phalothorax, than in Attus: in E. *reticulata (BLACKW.) = E. frontalis Q
(WESTR.) the hindermost eyes are situated actually almost in the middle of
the eephalothorax E. petrensis C. KOCH is the only species of this ge-
nus known to me, in which the design of the abdomen formed by the di-
stribution of its colours depends 011 a tolerably thick covering of hair3 or-
dinarily the hair is thin and the markings occasioned by the pigment si-
tuated in the skin itself. — The olaws are long and very slender, with
few or no teeth; in E. frontalis Ι have observed on the inner claw of the
1st pair two very small teeth. The hairs of the claw-tuft are sensibly di-
lated at the extremity.

Type: Philceus sanguinolentus (LINN.).

I am not sure that the distinctive features of this genus set forth by
me are quite trustworthy‚ for Ι have met with the male only of one of its
species, Ph. sanyuz'nolentus. The genus however seems to be perfectly well
distinguished from Attus and other nearly related forms even by its entire
general appearance. — As the name Philia, according to AGASSIZ' No-
mencl. Zool.⁷ was already in 1842 appropriated by SOHIGDTE to a genus of
Hemiptera‚ I could not preserve it, but have replaced it with the somewhat
similar name Phileous. V

In Ph. sanyuinolentus the inner claw of the 1St pair of legs has about
20 close-set teeth gradually and slightly increasing in length, and the outer
claw about 6 coarse, sparse teeth. The hairs of the claw-tuft are long,
slightly dilated at the extremity. On the 4t¹¹ pair of legs the number of teeth
is respectively about 13 and 5.
