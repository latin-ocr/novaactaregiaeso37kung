Type: Attus terebratus (CLERCK).

’ When C. KOOH in 1837 (106. 611.) divided the old genus Attus WALCK.
or Salticus LATR. into a number of smaller genera, 116 preserved the Walc-
kenaerian name for a generic group that includes A. terebratus (CLEROK) and
A. arcuatus (111). Since several 51166165, which KOCH in the same work referred
to Euoplzrys, ought also to be reckoned to 1116 5111116 genus, he some years
afterwards transferred that appellation to the genus Attus, and gave the
name of Actus to a portion of the 51166165, which he had formerly called
Euophrys. Such alterations of names no one of course can have the right
of making, and we have accordingly restored the generic name Attus to the
spiders7 Which KOCH first under that name detached from WALCKENAER'S
Attus. Of Euophrys we have already treated p. 216.

The genus Attus, as we have above defined it, includes the great
majority of European Attoidae. Perhaps one or more well defined genera
might with advantage still be detached from it3 Ι have not however, pos-
sibly for want of sufficient material for examination⁷ been able 10 do so. As
I define this genus, it corresponds to KOCH⁷S Euophrys 1850, with the ex-
elusion of the sub-genera Dia and Parthenia, which Ι considered might very
well 116 united into one separate genus: AElurops.

The armature of the claws in the genus Attus is tolerably various.
Generally speaking the teeth of the inner claw are close-set and far more
numerous than those of the outer claw; but oecasionally⁷ e. g. on the ΔΝ
pair of legs in A. cruczfer⁷ the number is small and about equal on both
claws. Sometimes the teeth gradually and uniformly increase in length
towards the point of the claw, sometimes they are of almost equal length
