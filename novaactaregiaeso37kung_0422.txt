220 T. THORELL,

Of this genus, which, according to SIMON, is distinguished by the
lamina of the palpal clava being ''releve' en cre'te'', I have seen only one in-
dividual, a male of the typical species, which SIMON had the goodness to
send me. That spider in its entire appearance agrees most accurately with
AElurops v-z'wzsiyrzz‘tzcs, but it differs not only by the peculial· structure of the
palpi, but also by the far greater length of the posterior legs, especially
the tibiae. The claws also are particularly strongly developed: they are
very long, even longer than those of AElurops‚ slender and sinuated, espe-
cially on the hindermost legs, where they have in front of the middle a row of
about 12 very long, closely set comb-teeth. The claws of the 1⁶t pair,
whose tarsi, like those of the 2¹¹d pair, are on the underside clothed with
hairs dilated at the apex, are much shorter than those of the posterior pairs
of legs, but still long, slightly and uniformly curved, with about as many
teeth of the same form as on the following pairs, but here the row of
teeth commences near-er to the base of the claw. The claws, especially on
the hinder legs, are so large and visible, that both they and their pectina-
tion may be observed with a good single lens. The hairs of the claw-tuft
are dilated near the extremity in the posterior legs, in the 1⁵* pair the di-
latation is more gradual.

Fossil spiders have in the preceding pages not be taken into ac-
count, simply because I am not by actual inspection acquainted with any,
and I therefore was not in a condition to form from observatione of my
own an opinion of the relations between them and now existing forms.
Some short notices on this subject, with special reference to those extinct
²syenem, which (as far as I am aware) up to the present time have been
published, may however be of interest to some few araohnologists, and I
offer them the more readily, because Ι have not found, that in any work
on the classification of spiders proper attention has been paid to the fos-
sil forms.

These animals, as the usually soft and perishable character of their
integuments would lead us to expect, have left but few traces of their exist-

previous to Sunon’s description loc. eit. In Kocn and BERENDT, Die im Bernstein
befindl. Crust, Myriapod, Arachn. ete., p. 93, MENGE has, it is true, mentioned a
Prussian spider under the name of Phidippus arenarius, which perhaps is the same
as Yllenus arenarius SrM., but it is not characterized, and accordingly I could not
refer to MENGE as authority for the name.
