enee in the fossiliferous deposits, and it is only in Amber that we meet with
them numerously represented. The oldest known spiders belong to the
Coal formation, in the strata of whieh a few speeiinens have been found
in Boheniia 1) and Silesia 2), and probably also in England ³). Only one
speeies belonging to that period is in sufficiently good preservation to be
tolerably well oharaeterized, viz. the Protolycosa cmtlzrczcoplziloe described by
R6MER‚ whieh was discovered in a piece of argillaoeons slate at Kattowitz
iu Upper Silesia. It forms the type of the genus

Prololycosa Rom. 1866 ⁴). This spider, which is about 5 lines long,
is by ROMER placed in the vieinity of [μεθείη but this appears to me not
to be right. The eyes and spinners, if indeed these organs ever existed,
have unfortunately perished3 nor is it possible to form any elear idea of the
appearance of the mandibles⁷ and it is therefore impossible to determine
with absolute certainty the systematio position of the animal3 nevertheless
its general appearance aud especially its extremely σθαι-36 <md strony Zeys

the Territelarise, and among these it is that wonderful East Indian genus
Liphiscius SCHIoDTE⁷ that Protolycosa most nearly resembles. Not only do
these two genera agree in the unusual relative length of the legs — in
Lz'plzz'stz'us the proportion of the different pairs is 4, 2, 3, 1, in Protolgscosa
4, ffi, 1, and thus in both tlze Ν pair ῖς the shorcest of alh — but in
