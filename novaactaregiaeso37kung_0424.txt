to the family Liplzz'stz'oidoe NOB. (vid. p. 43), unless it be preferred to create
a new family especially for it, a proceeding, which perhaps the zmusually
short femoral joz'nts of the palpz' (see ROMER'S figures), as also two back-ward-
directed spz‘nes in tlte midst of each side of the abdomen might Justify.

Phalanyiles MUNST. 1839 = Palpipes ROTH 1851. In the lithographic
limestone of Solenhofen in Bavaria, belonging to the ιῙὲιναεείε formation, Mon-
sTER detected the impression of a previously unknown animal, which, on
account of its resemblance to a Phalanyz'um, he called Plzalanyz‘tes priscus 1).
ROTH ²), Who had at his disposal several specimens, which he divides into
two species, thought he could clearly perceive the contour of an abdomen
separated from the cephalothorax, and observed two long, jointed and cross-
ringed organs, attached to the abdomen and united at the base, which he
considered to be spimzem, and he accordingly aggregated these animals to the
Order of Spiders. He named the genus Palpz'pes, and considered that
it ought to be referred to the lllyyalz'cles (Tewz'celarioe); he characterizes
it as follows: ⁷'Cephalothorax ab abdomine discretus. Palpi maximi, in
pedes mutati. Pedum paria longitudine diversa. Tarsi monomeri, ungui va-
lido simplici terminati. Papillae textoriae duae magnae exsertae, vel aliud
quoddam organum bipartitum, cornutum, articulatum, in medio ventre situm,
cornubus antice vergentibus.'' — The figure given by ROTH of P. priscas really
gives the impression of a spider with uncommonly long and thin legs and
very long, leg-like palpi. Examples of still existing spiders with but one
tarsal claw are not wanting (Sparassus abnormis BLACKW., Attus (Diolenz‘us)
phrynoz'cles WALCK.: See above pp. 170 and 203); very long cross-rz'nyed
spinners occur also in another fossil spider‚ Gerslia mynra MENGE, of
which we shall speak iarther on. Their abnormal position and direction in
Phalanyz'tes may be a consequence of the animal's having been crushed and
the relative position of the parts thus changed. In the mean time it is
maintained by V. MEYER ³), that what Rom looked upon as the contour of

Pantopoda (Pycnoyonoidea).
