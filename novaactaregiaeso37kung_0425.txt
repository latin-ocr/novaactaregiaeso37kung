an abdomen, is the impression of a 5¹¹¹ pair of short and slender legs, and
that accordingly the animal does not belong to the Atraclmoidea, neither to
the Opiliones, nor to the sio-avem, but to the Crustacea. This view appears
to me to have but little probability, as giving no satisfactory explanation
of the organs observed in many specimens, and by Ro'rH supposed to be
spinners. To consider them with V. MEYER as aaronque, would seem dan-
gerous, as they are always found on or near the abdomen (Conf. RoTH,
loc. cit). That the contour of the abdomen gives the impression of a pair
of jointed and converging extremities, might be explained by considering
the abdomen itself to have been segmentatcd. At all events the animals
in question are so peculiar, that they not only form a separate fanrily,
Ploalaaeeyitoidoe‚ but even a group of a higher order, which may be cal-
led FILIGRADAE; if, as I suppose, this group belong to the order of Spi-
ders, it ought, as a separate sub-order, characterized especially by siozyle-
jointed tao-si armed wirla but one coarse elam, to take a place below both
Scytodoz'dae and Fz'lz‘statoz'cloe, uniting them with the Opiliones.

Numerous representatives of the order of Spiders from the tertiary
formations are already known. They appear alito belong to the miocene, or
(the amber spiders) perhaps to a still older period. From the fresh-water
formations near Aix in Provence MARCEL DE SERRES 1) has produced a ''Te-
yenaria’', as also a ’'Pli.celan9imn’' said to resemble Phalawfflz'wn phaleratum
PANZER, i. e. Asayena phalerata. I imagine it to be this last-named species,
that is figured in BUCKLAND'S Geology and Mineralogy 2), and for which the
same place of discovery is alleged, it closely resembles a Theridium. I
propose to call it T ἠ. Bucklandii. In the sulphur-impregnated tertiary strata
of Radoboj in Oroatia several spiders are also said to be found ³). VON
HEYDEN describes the remains of two spiders, discovered in the Brown-
coal strata of the Siebengebirge 011 the Rhine, which he calls Gea Krcmtziz' 4)
and Aryyroneta antiqua ⁵). The first seems to me to be a species of Epeion,-
the second is certainly no Aryyroneta, but represents, if the figure can
be relied upon, a peculiar genus, which may be called
