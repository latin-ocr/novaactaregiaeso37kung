Elvina N. 1). This genus appears to be distinguished by the palpz‘ beiny
evidently tlzz'cker than the lays. Its nearer relationsbips it is not possible from
V. HEYDEN'S description and figure to determine: probably it may belong
to the Tubiteldrz'ae, aud possibly to the Ayalenoz‘doe (Aryyronetz‘noe).

In the also miocene fresh-water strata of OEningen (near the Lake of
Constance in Switzerland), OSWALD HEER 2) 1165 met with no less than 28 spe-
cies of spiders, which it is however difficult to affiliate to any certain genera,
as the position of the eyes etc. cannot be distinguished. HEER thinks they
may be referred to 1Ο genera, which, with 0116 exception, are still existing.
These spiders are not described, but eleven species have been figured and.
named: of these one is assigned to Epeira‚ 3 to leerz'dz'um, 1 to Amyro-
neta [-necta]‚ 1 to Cluhiona, 1 to Miaarz'a [Macaria] and 3 to ’'leomisus⁷⁷.
But scarcely one of these species appears to be in so good a state of pre-
servation that the identifications 6611 116 considered as fully certain. The-
ridimn maculipes HEER (loc. cit., p. 356, fig. 219) is more like an Asa‘qena
than a Tlterz’dium. Thomz‘sus oenz‘wyensis HEER (fig. 215) would seem to be
a Asvsstz'czffl. Clubz'ovna Eseri HEER, Which is stated to be very like ΟΖ. Za-
nata KOOH et BER. (of which more hereafter) is assuredly no Clubioua, nor
is Arqyroneta longyipes HEER any Aryyroneta. These two species seem to
form each its own separate genus. For one species HEER forms, as we
have above stated, a new genus:

Schellenherglia HEER 1865 3). Of his S. rotundam (fig-211) HEER says,
that it is distinguished by '’the short palpi with a large, globular terminal
joint, short and almost globular abdomen, pressed close to the breast, and
provided with transversal impressions. The third pair of legs is the short-
est, all the others being of nearly equal length. The thighs are furnished
with a longitudinal rib.⁷' The animal (a 02) belongs without doubt to the
Ιίετὶέείανὶιε, 611(1 appears to me to stand between Episz'nus and Ero.

In the fossi] vegetable resin known under the name of amber, which is
met with in various Brown-eoal strata, and is copiously thrown by the waves
on the southern coasts of the Baltic, especially the coast of Prussia and
the Kurisehe Haaff, and which also belongs to the tertiary (‘’oligocene⁷⁷) pe-
riod, numerous spiders are found, and are, in general, well preserved. The
principal work 011 the subject of these Amber Spiders is that of KooH and
