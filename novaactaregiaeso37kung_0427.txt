ΟΝ EUROPEAN SPIDERS. 225

und Apteren der Vorwelt1), which, after the death of thc authors, was
published by A. MENGE, and provided by him with many important addi-
tions and corrections. The number of Spider-species found in Amber appearS,
according to Kocfl's and MENGE'S works, to amount to about 1303 of these
nearly 100 are fully described and figurcd, for the most part in KOCH aud
BERENDT'S above-named work, two others in a lately published paper of
MENGE ²). Of several of the remaining species MENGE has, partly in KOOH
and BEREND'r⁷S work, partly in a separate memoir 3), given more or less
detailed descriptive notiees. As we are now about to give a short account
of the extinct genera made known by KOCH and MENGE in the above-men-
tioned works, it will probably be best, in consequence of their somewhat
considerable number, to treat· each family separately, in the order in which
they have been classed in the foregoing pagos. It should however be re-
marked that the characteristics of many of these genera are by the said
authors only touched upon in a few words and cursorily, so that it is not
always possible to form a sure judgment of their systematic position.

a. Epeiroz'doe. To this family we refer the following genera:

Groea N. 4) = Gea (Koon et BER.) 1854. — The fossil species,
which KOCH and MENGE reckon to Gea, differ from Epeira by having the
anterior central eyes much larger than the posterior, and sitting close to-
gether on small protuberances (vid. KOCH and BERENDT, p. 22—243 MENGE‚
Lebenszeichen, p. G). This is however by no means the case in the now
existing, East Indian species of Gen, G. spz'nz'pes O. KOCH3 for in that spe-
cie-s the posterior central eyes, which are placed uncommonly far backward,
are larger than the anterior, according to KOCH himself ⁵). The exstinct
spiders in question cannot therefore be affiliated to Gea O. KOCH 1843,
but form an independent genus, for which we propose the name Grcea,
with G. epeiroz'dea (K. et B.) as the type.

Antope'a MENGE 1854 ⁶). This genus is distinguished by its coni-
cally prominent head3 the oentral eyes form a trapezoid, and are larger
