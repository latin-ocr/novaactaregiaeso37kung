and placed higher up than the lateral eyes (vid. KOCH et BER„ p. 433 Le-

a fllizalz'a.

›Si-qa MENGE 1854 1). Is said to be nearly related to Zilla: ⁷'The
head is prominent, the posterior central eyes farther apart than the anterior,
the palpi of the male provided with au involuted (zusammengerollten) fla-
gellum ⁷⁷. — S. crinita MENGE (KOCH and BER, p. 27).

Androgyeus K. et B. 1854 ²). The head is triangularly or conically
pointed3 the eyes are arranged in two longitudinal rows diverging from the
front baekwards, and thus occupy a triangular area⁷ the point of which is
formed by the anterior central eyes3 the hindermost eyes are placed far
backwards on the back of the cephalothorax, much as in fIyptiotes and
Poltys‚ which latter genus also in the form of its head resembles Andro-
¹qens. KOCH united these three genera in his family Mz'thraides (Allitlzracz'doe).
Aozd2¹0962cs probably belongs to our Uloborinae, and assuredly not to the La-
teri-qradcffi with which MENGE thinks it ought to be classed. — Type: A.
triqueter K. et B. — Oonf. KOGH and BER.. p. 27—293 Lebenszeich„ p. 9.

Of still existing genera, Epeira and Zilia are said to be represented3
the species of Zz'Zla described in KOCH and BER. do not however belong to
Zilia, as we have fixed the limits of that genus, and probably not even to
the Epeiroidae⁷ but to the Thericlioidae: they are said by MENGE to resemble
”illem tiyrz‘nff (Linyphia socialis SUND.) in the position of the eyes and in
the legs (vid. Kocfl and BER„ p. 27).

b. Theridioz’doe. The following genera appear to belong to this
family:
Fleyia K. et B. 1854 3). Is nearly related to Episz'mcs‚ according

to MENGE‚ but the eyes are placed on a prominent elevation sloping be-
hind. The cephalothorax is founded, its pars cephalica small; the abdomen

ι ovate, the legs long3 the palpi of the male are very long, with a very

large clava. The posterior central eyes are larger than the anterior. —
Type: F. Zorzyinwzana K. et B. — Conf. KoeH and BER, p. 30.

corymbis MENGE 1854 4). Nearly allied with Fla-fia,- it is distin-
guished ”by its larger anterior central eyes, and by the male's still longer
palpi, the fourth joint of which is slender at the base, incrassated in the
