form of a clnb at the extremity, with the clava itself almost spherical.'' -

Anmnlrus MENGE 185ss ¹). Of this genus MENGE only says that it
is ”nearly related to Linyplzz'a, but the male⁷s palpi and organs of copula-
tion are very small.” (Lebenszeich.‚ p. Τ).

Tloyelia K. et B. 1854 2). In the position of the eyes Thyeh'a ap-
proximates to Clnbz'ona: they are placed in two parallel or only slightly
convcrging rows3 the four posterior eyes, which are placed at about the
same distance from each other, form an almost straight line, as do also
the four anterior eyes3 the central eyes form a trapezoid broadcr behind.—
From most of the figures (as f. inst. that of the typical species) given in
KOCH and BER„ leyelia appears to belong to the Theridioidae, but other
species, viz. le. mmyz'nata (Pl. VI, fig. 45) and Th. anomala (Pl. V, fig.
39) more nearly resemble the Ayalenoidoe (to which family the genus was
referred by KOCH), and probably do not belong to Thyeh'a (Conf. MENGE in
KOCH et BER„ p. 56). —- MENGE says loc. cit. that leyelz’a differs from its
relations Clubz'ona and Anzanrohz'us by a ''narrower head and laterally pro-
Jecting spines on the else fine-haired legs''; in Lebenszeich.‚ p. 7, he clas-
ses it with the Theridioidae on account of the short spinners and the arma-
ture of the legs. — Type: leyelz'a tristis K. et B. — Oonf. KOCH and BER,
p. 50—56.

Clya K. et B. 1854 3). — Is considered by ΚΟΟΗ to approximate
to Eucharia (Steawda NOB.) in the form of the body, the legs and the
palpi. The head is elevated above the rounded pars thoracica; the abdo-
men is short, very conveX. The eyes of the posterior series are placed
on a sharp prominent ridge curved backwards3 the central eyes, which are
of the same magnitude, form a square3 the lateral eyes are nearer together
and about half as large as the central eyes. — Type: Ο. Zuyubrz's K. et
Β. — Vid. KOCH and BER, p. 31.

As possibly belonging to the Theridioidae, MENGE mentions:

Dtelacata MENGE 1854 4). Nothing more is said of this genus, than
that it has only two spinners, and two tracheal stigmata before the spin-
ners. — D. superba MENGE. (ΚοοΗ and BER„ p. 943 Lebenszeich., p. 9).

1) α priv„ and α’νήρ, man, male (probably with reference to the small sexual
organs of (ᾗ).

2) Perhaps from θυηλή, victim.

3) Deriv. unknown.

4) δίς, twice, ἠλακάτη, distaff.
