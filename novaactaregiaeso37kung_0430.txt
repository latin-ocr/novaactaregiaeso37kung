228 T. Trionem,

The following still existing genera are stated to have representatives
in the Prussian amber: Ero, meridiam, Ενὶροηε, Walelcenaera [llIicryplzan-
tes]‚ Euryopz's [ms] and Linyphia.

0. Scytocloidoe. MENGE mentions (Lebenszeioh.‚ p. 9) a speeies of
Pholcus, as also a new genus, perhaps belonging to this family:

PlealangJopus MENGE 1854 1), of whioh however it is only said, that
it is related to Pholem, with long, slender legs, but with the eyes placed
otherwise. —Pli subtilis MENGE. Vid. KOCH and BER.‚ p. 943 Lebenszeieh.‚ p. 9.

d. M italioidoe N. The ourious genus Miealm, which in KOCH and
BERENDT is elassed among the Theridioiclta but which MENGE (Lebenszeieh.‚
p. 8) refers to his Clubz'onida (z Drassoz'da -Ι- Dysderoialae NOB.), appears to
me to form the type of a quite peeuliar family, perhaps most related to the
Urocz‘eoidoe in the sub-order Tabitelarice. The characters of this family may
be seen from those of the only known genus:

Mizalia (K. et Β.) 18542). The cephalothorax is in the form of a
broad inverted heart3 the pars cephalica, which has the same height
as the slightly eonvex⁷ broad pars thoraclea, is drawn out in a kind
of snout before the eyes. The eyes are about equal in magnitude and
placed in two transversal rows 011 the superior side of the head: the
anterior, shorter row is ourved backwards, the posterior row is nearly
straight. The legs are rather short and strong (as are also the palpi),

their relative length 1, Ξῖ, 33 the abdomen is short, ovate3 the superior
or posterior spinners are slender, oonieally pointed, the intermediate spin-
ners cylindrical aud more than double as Zony as the inferior (anterior), Which
are ἐι-1111051011, oonieal and thieker. — Type: M. rostrata K. et B. — Conf.
Koon and BER, p. 42—45.

e. Hersilioicle. Resides an Hersilia (of which genus no speeies is
known now to exist in Europe: Conf. p. 115), a new genus belonging to
this family has been found in the Prussian amber:

Ger-dia MENGE 1869 ³). This remarkable genus is nearly related to
Hersilia: but the head is raised into a high vertical boss, and the legs are
destitute of the long, third tarsal joint found in Hersilia (according to MENGE
the tarsi are only two-j0inted). The very long three-jointed superior spin-
ners are eurved downwards towards their extremity3 their long third joint

1) φάλαγξ, joint3 πούς, leg (or perhaps Plzalanffiam and πούς).
2) Deriv. unknown to me. Probably a proper name.
3) ”Γέρδια, te.vtrz'x'’: MENGE.
