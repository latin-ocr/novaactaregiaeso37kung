appears to he thickly annulatcd. -— Type: G. myura MENGE. — Conf. MENGE,
Ueber einen Scorp. u. zwei Spinn. im Bernstein, p. 8-9.

f. Agyalenoidce. The ambcr fauna contains several species of Aman-
robz'us (Coeloteff), Teyenarz'a and Agyalmzcz, but probably not of Teme-im, to
which genus KOOH had referred a couple of species. — Conf. MENGE in
Kocn et Baa, p. 49, 50.

g. Drassoidae. The following genera I place in this family:

Analone MENGE 1854 ¹). Of this genus MENGE says (in KOCH and
BER„ p. 84) that the eyes are placed as in th'lodromus, but the four an-
terior eyes are scarcely half as large as the four posterior. In Lebenszcich.,
p. 8, Anatone is said to differ from Zora only in having the posterior cen-
tral and lateral eyes placed nearer together. One species, A. spinz'pes MENolE
is stated to stand very close to Zora spinimarna KoCH. MENGE refers the
genus to the Lycosoz'doe.

Sosibius [Sosybius] K. et B. 1854 ²). Is according to MENGE (Le-
benszeich„ p. 8) so nearly related to Cluhiom, as scarcely to be distin-
guishable from that genus. —- The four anterior eyes are placed near the
margin of the clypeus in 311 almost straight line, the posterior central eyes
are very small, almost invisible, the anterior central eyes are somewhat
smaller than the latera] eyes, which are about equally large. — Type: S.
minor Κ. et B. Vid. MENGE, in Kocn and BER„ p. ΤΟ. - Kocu, who
believed that the eyes were arranged in quite another way, united this ge—
nus with Eriodon and Selenops (l) into a family, which he called Eriodon-
tidoe (loc. cit., p. 69).

Erimus MENGE 1854 3). The latcral and the anterior central eyes,
which are all large, flat and close together, are arranged in a single row
curved backwards, near the margin of the clypeus, the posterior central
eyes are smaller and placed on the superior side of the head. Nothing
more is said of this genus. —- E. applcmatus MENGE (KOCH and BER, p. 69).

Helm-omma MENGE 185ss 4). IS said to unite Cluhiona and Mela-
nophora with Seyestria. Six large eyes are placed quite as in 869831νὶ61,-
behind them are two very small eyes (the posterior central eyes), the diame-
ter of which is scarcely equa] to ξ of that of the anterior central eyes, to
this is to be added the peculiarity, that the abdomen is short-petiolated.

l) ’'dvcizovog, sursum tendens‘⁷: MENGE (ἀνά, up; τείνω, stretch).

2) Σωσίβιος, proper name, Sosybius ought therefore to be written Sosibius.
3) ἔριθος, labourer, also, female Weaver.

4) ἕτερος, another, dissimilar-3 ὄμμα, eye.
