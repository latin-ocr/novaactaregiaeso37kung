230 T. THORELL,

The following two genera, which are said to be related to Clubz’ona
(MENGE, Lebenszeiclr, p. 9), ought perhaps also to be classes] among the
Drassoidae:

Spleeconz‘a MENGE 18541): it is stated to have ”a longshafted,
fusiform abdomen and long spinners'’: — S. brevipes MENGE3 and

Idmom‘a MENGE 1854 ²): ”the ellipso‘idally arched pars cephalica
is separated from the in front beart-shaped pars thoracica3 the eyes enclose
an ellipsis.⁷’ — I. viryinea MENGE. — Vid. KOCH and BER, p. 94.

Of the genera C‘Zubiona, Angsphwna, Illic-aria [Macaria], Dragmos,
Illelanophora and Gnaplzosa [Pythonsz'ssa] several species are described or
mentioned 111 KOCH and BER. and MENGE. Of the genus Clubz'om however
at least one of the species described by KOCH, O. lanata (loc. cit, p. 67,
Tab. VII, fig. 60) appears to me to belong to a quite different and pe-
euliar genus.

h. Dysderoz'cloe. To this family belongs:

Ther-ea K. et B. 1854 ³) The pars cephalica is distinctly separated
from and higher than the pars thoracica. Six eyes, all close together, the
central eyes occupy a trapezoidsomewhat broader 111 front, on each side of
which is an obliquely placed lateral eye3 the posterior central eyes are a
little smaller than the others, which are equa] in size. The genus is else
nearly related to Dysdera. — Type: leerea petiolum K. et B.—Vid. KOOH
and BER, p. 75.

Many other spiders belonging to this family, of the genera Seyescria'
and Dysdera (10 species of the former genusl), have been found in amber.

i. leeraplzosoidoe. To this family the following genus no doubt
belongs:

Closles MENGE 1869 4). C‘. priscus MENGE, the only known species,
resembles, according to MENGE, in the form of its body Clotho and (lterum,
in the spinners, lllygyale. The eyes, which are placed on a quadrangular
elevation of the head, in two rows, occupy a large, transversal area and
are arranged 111 a manner very unusual in the Theraphosoidae: the four
central eyes form a square, enclosed 111 a rectangle formed by the four la-
teral eyes. The superior spinners are very long, tln·ee-j0inted; the tarsi
