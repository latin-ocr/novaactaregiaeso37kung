are armed with three olaus, as in Nemesia (Ctenz'za)‚· the superior claws are
pectinated. — Conf. MENGE, Ueber einen Scorp. u. zwei Spinn. im Bern-
stein, p. (3, 7.

k. leomz‘soz‘dffl We assign to this family:

Clyllu‘a K. et B. 1854 ¹). The eyes are placed in two parallel rows
curved backwards, the four anterior eyes are small, equal in size, the po-
sterior four much larger, also equal in size. The legs are rather strong,
not much longer than the body, armed with spines on the underside of the
tibiae and metatarsi3 the tarsi are thick, with long, pectinated claws. -— In
its general appearance and the structure of the tarsi these spiders are, ae-
cording to MENGE (KOCH and BER, p. 46), more intimately related to Ocy-
pete (Heteropoda, Spm‘assus) than to the leeridioidoe, to which family he
however in Lebenszeieh„ p. 7, reckons them, as also KOCH had done (KOCH
and BER, p. 94). — Type: G. alma K. et R, l. c.. p. 45.

Alleera MENGE 1854 2). ''Long and slender, the anterior centra]
eyes small and close together, the posterior central eyes more than double
as large, far apart, on each side of the last are the large lateral eyes.
A. emilisff' (KOCH and BER, p. 94). —— Nothing more is known of the genus,
which in Lebenszeieh.‚ p. 9, is taken up among the Thomz'soz'doe.

Opistlmpleylaoe MENGE 185ss ³). Of this genus MENGE only says:
”Eyes as in Philodromus, but the posterior eentral eyes are very large and
looking forwards, and the posterior lateral eyes placed far baekwards. O.
emaratast (Lebenszeich., p. 9).

Syphaoe K. et B. 1854 4). This genus is nearly related to A’ysfficus.
The pars cephalica is large and b1·0ad; the two anterior central eyes are
exceedingly small, the two posterior lai-ger, farther apart, the anterior late-
ral eyes are very large. The row formed by the 4 anterior eyes is curved
slightly backwards or almost straight, the posterior row is curved more
strongly backwards. — Type: S. meyacephalus K. et B. —— Conf. KOCH and
BER, p. 77.

The now existing genera Heteropoda [Ocypete KOCH, Omypete MENGE],
Artanes [Artamusfi Philodromus and Mz‘sumena (‘?— ’'Thomisus'' MENGE)
have also representatives among the amber spiders.

1) Perhaps = Clytia, mythol. proper name. - Clytia is a name already many
times appropriated. [Clytia LAMOUROUX [Polypi] 18123 Clytia HUBN. [Lepidopt]
lsslssifitfglbfie, non fera et venenata’': MENGE. (ἄθηρος, without chase‚ game).

3) ὄπισθεν, behind3 φύλαξ, guard, ''retrospiciens”: MENGE.

4) Σύφαξ, proper name.
