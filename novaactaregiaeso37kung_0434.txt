232 T. THORELL,

l. Archaeoidae [Archaeidae] K. et B. This family has been created
by KOOH for the remarkable genus

Arcleoea K. et B. 1854 ¹). The large head is much and, in gene-
ral, spherieally elevated above the pars thoraeica, which is narrower be-
hind. The eyes are arranged in two rhomb-like groups, one on each side
of the head. The mandibles are strong, often very elongated, with a long
claw. The palpi are uncommonly small and slender, especially in the fe-
male. The legs are rather long and slender, prop. 1, 2, 4, 3. — Type:
A. paradoma K. et B. — KOGH considered this genus not to be related to
any other known spiderSJ MENGE first (in KOCH and BER„ p. 22) believed
it had most affinity with Tetraynatlm: the form of the legs as given in
KOCH’S figures, reminds one in fact much of that genus and of Pachyyna-
tha, which latter genus some species also resemble in their large, diverging
mandibles. But in Lebenszeich., p. 9, MENGE refers Arehtea to the Lateri—
ργασία) (leomz'sida MENGE), on account of the form and direction of the fore-
legs (which is said to be the same as in the Laterz'gyradae) and of the short
and slender posterior legs. The position of the eyes is quite the same as in
Platythomz'sus DOLESCH. (vid. sup, p. 170). Itherefore place Archaea among
the Laterigradae3 but this genus may perhaps for the present best be taken
as the type of a separate family, distinguished by its ovate cephalothorax
with the curiously formed pars cephalica, by the extraordinarily small palpi,
and the large mandibles. — Conf. KoCH and BER, p. 19-22.

m. Lycosoz‘doe. By MENGE the following genus is referred to the
Lycosoidae, *of which family no more representatives appear to have been
found in amber:

Linoptes MENGE 1854 2). Nothing more is said of this genus, than
that it has a slender body, long legs, long and slender abdomen and eyes
resembling those of Lycosa. — L. oculeus MENGE. Vid. KOCH and BER,
p. 943 Lebenszeielr, p. 8.

n. Eresoidoe. Two speeies 01 1110 genus Eresus.

o. Actoiclce. To this family several species belong, which are de-
scribed in KOOH and BER. under the generic names of Phidippus and Leda.
The genus Leda appears to be founded 011 a damaged specimen, and can—
not therefore 110 1010111011; moreover the name is already appropriated 3).
The species which KOCH reckons to Pkidz'ppm, do not, according to MENGE,

1) ἀρχαῖος, primitive, ancient.
2) λινόπτης, guarder of a net.
3) Leda SCHUM. [Moll] 1817.
