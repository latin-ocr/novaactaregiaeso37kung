belong to that still existing, exotio genus. MENGE creates for them — with
the exception of 0116 species, which he assigns to Euoplzrys O. KOCH
(Attus (WALCK.) NOB.) — a new genus:

Gon-qopis MENGE 1854 l). This genus, which is said to be nearly
related to Euophrys O. KOCH (Attus NOB.)‚ appears to be charaeterized prin-
cipally by having the small eyes of the 2¹¹d series placed at a very short
distance behind the anterior laterai eyes3 they are also somewhat less distant
from each other than are the two eyes of the 3¹d row. The fourth pair of
legs is longer than the others. —— Type: G. frenata (K. et B.). -— Oonf.
KOCH and BER, p. 93).

Propere-⁹ MENGE 1854 ²). Of this genus MENGE only says that it
differs from the genera, into which KOOH has resolved WALCKENAER'S Actus,
by having the eyes of the 2““1 row but slightly smaller than those of the
3¹⁸ row, and larger than in now living species. —- Type: P. felinus MENGE.
Vid. Kocfl and BER„ p. 93.

One species of KOCH'S exstinct Pkidz'ljpz‘, is, as we have already said,
by MENGE referred to Attus, or Euophrys MENGE3 in Lebenszeich. (p. 9) that
name is however not mentioned, but instead of it: ''Salticus 1 sp.''

Lastly Ι ought to cite the genus:

Illa-stimma MENGE 1854 3), whose affinities are entirely unknown:
of the only mentioned species, M. acuminata MENGE, it is stated that the
male has on its palpi ⁷'flagella which are eurved backwards in form of a
ram’s horn (widderhorn-ahnlich nach hinten gebogenen Geisseln) and are al-
most as long as the body.'’ Vid. KOCH and BER„ p. 94.

Three more genera Οησα, Epeirz'dz'on and Θεία are mentioned by
MENGE (KOCH and BER.‚ p. 8 and 24; Lebenszeichn., p. 8), but they are
not at all characterized. The two former are said to belong to the Epei-
roidce, the last named is taken up among the Tltomisoidce.

Ι beg here to express my grateful acknowledgement to those Arach-
nologists who, since the printing of this treatise was commeneed, have as-
sisted me by the communication of valuable information or specimens of
interesting speeies. In addition to the gentlemen named in pp. 2 and 3,

1) γοργῶπις, fierce-looking.

2) προπετής, rash, hasty.

3) μαστιγόω, whip‚ scourge.
