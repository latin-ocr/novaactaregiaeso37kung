Pag. <55 (after Ulob01‘1721oe):

In a paper recently published (Descr. and sketches of two new spec.
of Aran. etc), CAMBRIDGE has given descriptions and figures of a highly
remarkable genus from Ceylon, ssliafflwnmopes CAMBR.‚ which as he, no
doubt rightly, thinks, is most nearly related to Uloborus and Hyptz'otes (Mi-
tiaras). What in the first place gives this genus a peculial· interest, is the
circumstance of its having only four eyes7 placed in a transversal row across
the pars eephalica3 so that now a veritable four-eyed spider is at last dis-
covered! (Conf. p. 28, note 1). But stliayrammopes is still more remark-
able by the absence of a separate sternal place, the legs being simply arti-
culated to the lower side of the cephalothorax, which forms the sternal sur-
face. This unique character would perhaps war-rant the formation of a spe-
cial family within the sub-order Orbitelariae for the genus in question3 but
in every other point of systeinatical importance it appears to me to agree
with the Uloborinae. — Two species, M. lewaz'tesiz' and M. Ferdz'nandz‘‚ are
described and figured.
